Data Imputation is normally done to fill one or more missing data attribute values. Imputation helps to perform supervised or un-supervised learning after the dataset is free from missing data. Learning process helps the discovery of hidden, valuable and important information that can provide insightful results. Imputation is a data pre-processing task that requires applying distance function to find missing values. In this paper, a distance function named MANTRA is proposed to impute missing data values. The distance function is also called as the imputation measure since it is designed for imputation of missing values. A working example is demonstrated that shows how imputation is achieved using proposed distance function, MANTRA. It is proved that the nominal value that is filled after imputation is same as the original.","medical record instances, data imputation, learning process, distance function, missing values.",,,,2018-10-01

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure. Improved accuracies of classifiers on U2R and R2L attacks have been recorded in the experimental results obtained for experiments conducted."," internet of things, data mining, security, intrusion detection, computational complexity.",,,,2017-09-01

Clustering and classification are the two approaches in data mining which may also be used to perform text classification and text clustering. The former is supervised while the later is un-supervised. In this paper, our objective is to perform text clustering by defining an improved distance metric to compute the similarity between two text files. We use incremental frequent pattern mining to find frequent items and reduce dimensionality. The improved distance metric may also be used to perform text classification. The distance metric is validated for the worst, average and best case situations [15].

The most common threats that we encounter on the internet are Malicious URLs and Malware.Traditional solutions for combating these threats, are to build a databases of known sources of trouble or/and using filters to restrict access to resources. This is however not dynamic enough to detect attacks of smart Cyber-criminals. Techniques such as type-squatting, domain-squatting , code obfuscation,etc are hard to identify using conventional methods. Thus to stay one step ahead in the war against Cyber-crime we need to use Machine and Deep learning enabled methods in our defense equipment . The tool Malware and Malicious URL Classifier (MAMUC) is a unique tool which has 3 features. The first feature helps us to identify if a given URL is malicious or benign. This classifier runs on a novel Malben dateset. The second feature is used to covert a malware sample from byte-code to its corresponding malware image. This called as malware visualization,which is a strategy used in static malware inspection. The third feature of the tool is a malware classifier. Once malware is converted to an image ,its analysis is simplified to a case of image classification. This part identifies to which family an input malware is most closely associated with. Once the malware family is identified it is easier to deal with it.

Mathura Bai, N. Mangathayaru, B. Padmaja Rani, and Shadi Aljawarneh [4], proposes an imputation measure for filling missing data values to make the incomplete medical datasets as complete datasets. Then the approach is to apply this imputation measure on imputed datasets to achieve improved classifier accuracies. The basic intention of the research study is to present an imputation measure to find the proximity between medical records and an approach for imputation of missing values in medical datasets to improve the accuracy of existing classifiers. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to existing approaches with respect to classifier accuracy and also by performing a non-parametric test called the Wilcoxon test.  The second article, “E-mail Fraud Attack Detection Using Hybrid Machine Learning Approach,” is written by Yousef A. Yaseen, Malik Qasaimeh, Raad S. Al-Qassas, and Mustafa Al-Fayoumi [5]. E-mail is an efficient way to communicate. It is one of the most commonly used communication methods, and it can be used for achieving legitimate and illegitimate activities. Many features that can be effective in detecting e-mail fraud attacks are still under investigation. This paper proposes an improved classification accuracy for fraudulent e-mails implemented through feature extraction and hybrid Machine Learning (ML) classifier that combines Adaboost and Majority Voting. Eleven machine learning classifiers are evaluated experimentally within the hybrid classifier. The performance of the e-mail fraud filtering is evaluated by using WEKA and R tool on a data set of 9298 e-mail messages. The utilized proposed e-mail features with the combination of Adaboost and Voting algorithms prove the efficiency of fraud e-mail detection  Intrusion detection systems play a key role in system security by identifying potential attacks and giving appropriate responses. As new attacks are always emerging, intrusion detection systems must adapt to these attacks. More work is continuously needed to develop and propose new methods and techniques to improve efficient and effective adaptive intrusion systems. Feature selection [1, 2, 6, 7] is one of the challenging areas that need more work because of its importance and impact on the performance of intrusion detection systems. The third article, “Intrusion Detection System for Malicious Traffic Using Evolutionary Search Algorithm” is written by Samar Al-Saqqaa, Mustafa Al-Fayoumib, Malik Qasaimehc, and Raad S. Al-Qassasb [8]. It applies an evolutionary search algorithm in feature subset selection for intrusion detection systems. The evolutionary search algorithm is applied to find the best subset of features for the intrusion detection system. The experimental study proved their approach promising to be used as a feature selection method for intrusion detection. The results showed better performance for the intrusion detection system in terms of accuracy and detection rate.  The app stores, for example, Google Play and Apple Play Store, provide a platform that allows users to provide feedback on the apps in the form of reviews. An app review typically includes a star rating followed by a comment. Recent studies have shown that these reviews possess a vital source of information that can be used by the app developers and vendors for improving the future versions of an app. However, in most cases, these reviews are present in unstructured form, and extracting useful information from them requires a great effort.

Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be performed in either snapshot or lattice-based approach. Sequential and SPAMINE methods for similarity-profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar are based on the snapshot database scan and lattice scan, respectively. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database time slot by time slot. The major limitation of Sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the disk for finding itemset support computations. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in the memory and also eliminates the need to retain database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a compressed time-stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference w.r.t each time slot and validating whether the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed Sequential approach is from the fact that it is a single database scan approach excluding the initial database scan performed for computing true supports of singleton items. VRKSHA overcomes the major limitation of retaining database in memory that is required by SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, MASTER algorithms. Experiment results prove that computational time and memory consumed by VRKSHA are significantly very much better than by approaches such as Naïve, Sequential, SPAMINE, and G-SPAMINE. To the best of our survey and knowledge, VRKSHA is the pioneering work to introduce and propose a compressed tree-based data structure for mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns in the area of time-profiled temporal association mining.","mining, association patterns, temporal database, time slots, itemsets, database scan, vrksha, similarity-profiled, compressed tree-based data structure, temporal association mining",,,VRK-C090,2020-11-01

Datasets generated in an IoT environment usually have missing values. The presence of missing values makes the classifier unsuitable for classification task. This article introduces (a) a novel imputation technique for imputation of missing data values (b) a classifier which is based on feature transformation to perform classification (c) imputation measure for similarity computation between any two instances that can also be used as similarity measure. The performance of proposed classifier is studied by using imputed datasets obtained through applying Kmeans, F-Kmeans and proposed imputation methods.

For experimental study in this article, we have used an open source dataset named distributed smart space orchestration system publicly available from Kaggle. Experiment results obtained are also validated using Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. It is proved that the performance of proposed approach is better when compared to existing classifiers when the imputation process is performed using F-Kmeans and K-Means imputation techniques.

Designing an efficient intrusion detection system has three primary challenges that include addressing high dimensionality problem, choice of learning algorithm, and distance or similarity measure used to find the similarity value between any two traffic patterns or input observations. Feature representation and dimensionality reduction have been studied and addressed widely in the literature and have also been applied for the design of intrusion detection systems (IDS). The choice of classifiers is also studied and applied widely in the design of IDS. However, at the heart of IDS lies the choice of distance measure that is required for an IDS to judge an incoming observation as normal or abnormal. This challenge has been understudied and relatively less addressed in the research literature both from academia and from industry. This research aims at introducing a novel distance measure that can be used to perform feature clustering and feature representation for efficient intrusion detection. Recent studies such as CANN proposed feature reduction techniques for improving detection and accuracy rates of IDS that used Euclidean distance. However, accuracies of attack classes such as U2R and R2L are not significantly promising. Our approach GARUDA is based on clustering feature patterns incrementally and then representing features in different transformation space through using a novel fuzzy Gaussian dissimilarity measure. Experiments are conducted on both KDD and NSL-KDD datasets. The accuracy and detection rates of proposed approach are compared for classifiers such as kNN, J48, naïve Bayes, along with CANN and CLAPP approaches. Experiment results proved that proposed approach resulted in the improved accuracy and detection rates for U2R and R2L attack classes when compared to other approaches.","anomaly detection system, malicious traffic patterns, intrusion detection system, dimensionality reduction, learning algorithm, distance measure, feature representation, clustering feature patterns, fuzzy gaussian dissimilarity measure, detection rates",,,VRK-J088,2020-01-01

The problem of the network anomaly detection is to determine, if the network incoming traffic is legitimate (or) anomalous. Automated detection systems designed to identify incoming anomalous traffic patterns usually apply widely used machine learning techniques. However, irrespective of any system model which is developed to identify anomalous traffic, all these models requires comparing anomalous and normal traffic patterns. Such comparisons implicitly depend on the ability of the underlying machine learning model to gauge the similarity between a known legitimate observation and the target. The efficiency of any network anomalous detection system depends on the use of distance (or) similarity measures and how they are actually applied. A novel distance function which can be applied to determine the similarity between two conditional feature pattern vectors is an important contribution of present research. Feature dimensionality is another important issue for any machine learning algorithm. In the present work, feature reduction is achieved using the proposed feature transformation technique. However, our approach for feature transformation uses the proposed gaussian distance function to achieve dimensionality reduction to represent the original input dataset in the new transformation space. We have also proposed new computation expressions for determining equivalent deviation and threshold in gaussian space. Experiments are performed on KDD and NSL-KDD datasets by considering widely applied classifier algorithms in various state-of-art research contributions.

Mining temporal patterns from these time series databases requires choosing and applying similarity measure for similarity computations and subsequently pruning temporal patterns. This research proposes a novel z-space based interest measure named as Krishna Sudarsana for time-stamped transaction databases by extending interest measure Srihass proposed in previous research. Krishna Sudarsana is designed by using the product based fuzzy Gaussian membership function and performs similarity computations in z-space to determine the similarity degree between any two temporal patterns. The interest measure is designed by considering z-values between z?=?0 and z?=?3.09. Applying the Krishna Sudarsana requires moving the threshold value given by user to a different transformation space (z-space) which is a defined as a function of standard deviation. In addition to proposing interest measure, new expressions for standard deviation and equivalent z-space threshold are derived for similarity computations. For experimental evaluation, we considered Naïve, Sequential and Spamine algorithms that applies Euclidean distance function and compared performance of these three approaches to Z-Spamine algorithm that uses Krishna Sudarsana by choosing various test cases. Experiment results proved the performance of the proposed approach is better to Sequential approach that uses snapshot database scan strategy and Spamine approach that uses lattice based database scan strategy.","Temporal itemset,Time profiled,Z-space,Interest measure,Prevalence,Similarity function,Timestamped transaction",,,VRK-J079,2019-03-02

Time profiled association mining has two main challenges that must be addressed. These include addressing i) dissimilarity measure that also holds monotonicity property and can efficiently prune itemset associations ii) approaches for estimating prevalence values of itemset associations over time. The pioneering research that addressed time profiled association mining is by J.S. Yoo using Euclidean distance. It is widely known fact that this distance measure suffers from high dimensionality. Given a time stamped transaction database, time profiled association mining refers to the discovery of underlying and hidden time profiled itemset associations whose true prevalence variations are similar as the user query sequence under subset constraints that include i) allowable dissimilarity value ii) a reference query time sequence iii) dissimilarity function that can find degree of similarity between a temporal itemset and reference. In this paper, we propose a novel dissimilarity measure whose design is a function of product based gaussian membership function through extending the similarity function proposed in our earlier research (G-Spamine). Our approach, MASTER (Mining of Similar Temporal Associations) which is primarily inspired from SPAMINE uses the dissimilarity measure proposed in this paper and support bound estimation approach proposed in our earlier research. Expression for computation of distance bounds of temporal patterns are designed considering the proposed measure and support estimation approach. Experiments are performed by considering naïve, sequential, Spamine and G-Spamine approaches under various test case considerations that study the scalability and computational performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results prove the scalability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

The support value of itemsets for frequent itemset mining is a numeric value of one dimension. In contrast to traditional frequent pattern mining the discovery of similar item sets from time stamped transaction datasets is recent research interest that is gaining immediate attention and interest from academia and industry. In similarity profiled temporal pattern mining, support of temporal items and temporal item sets is multi-dimension support time sequence. The idea is to obtain set of similar temporal item sets whose support values at different timeslots vary similar to the reference sequence. The challenge is to obtain set of all temporal item sets with minimum computation time and computation space. This research proposes a tree structure, KAALA VRKSHA for temporal pattern mining that finds the similarity between temporal patterns by applying Gaussian based distance function.

Yoo also introduced methods for pruning using distance bounds and proposed SEQUENTIAL, SPAMINE approaches.

Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be either snapshot or lattice based. Sequential method for similarity profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar is based on the snapshot database scan. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database, time slot by time slot. The major limitation of sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the memory for finding itemset supports. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a time stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference and validating if the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed sequential approach is from the fact that it does not require database retention in memory.

A time-stamped transaction (temporal) database may be viewed as a snapshot database defined over several time slots. The brute-force approach for finding support value for every possible itemset from the time-stamped temporal database requires 2n true support computations and repeated scan of the original database. This task increases the overall computational complexity. This problem was addressed in some of the past research studies such as SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, Z-SPAMINE by proposing support estimation and pruning approaches which substantially reduced the total number of true support computations. However, the limitation is that even these approaches required scanning the database repeatedly to know true supports of itemsets when itemset pruning condition fails. In this research, we propose a novel tree structure, called GANDIVA which facilitates to compute all itemset true supports by performing tree scan thus eliminating the database scan. The idea is to construct the tree called GANDIVA which helps to know supports of all time stamped temporal itemsets from the constructed tree. Another important advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require original database to be retained in the memory after time profiled pattern tree (GANDIVA) is constructed from the database. A case study showing the time profiled pattern tree generation process along with computation of true supports is demonstrated that shows the importance of proposed approach. The significant advantage of GANDIVA over SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, Z-SPAMINE, and MASTER is that GANDIVA requires zero database scans after the first scan is made. GANDIVA is the pioneering research to propose a novel tree-based framework for seasonal temporal data mining.","Support values, itemsets, snapshot databases, time-stamped temporal database, computational complexity, pruning, GANDIVA, tree structure, true supports, database scan, memory retention, case study, time profiled pattern tree, seasonal temporal data mining, zero database scans.",,,,2018-06-19

Soft computing principles such as fuzzy logic, evolutionary and nature inspired computations may be applied to analyze dynamically varying data. Analyzing temporal trends of association patterns requires handling the temporal data, as prevalence values of temporal patterns are implicitly vectors. Finding Prevalence values of temporal association patterns and validating them for similarity using conventional approach increases the computational complexity.

A pattern is temporally similar when it satisfies certain specified subset constraints. The naive and apriori algorithm designed for non-temporal databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns in the context of temporal databases. The brute force approach requires performing  true support computations for ‘n’ items; hence, an NP-class problem. Also, the apriori or fp-tree-based algorithms designed for static databases are not directly extendable to temporal databases to retrieve temporal patterns similar to a reference prevalence of user interest. This is because the support of patterns violates the monotonicity property in temporal databases. In our case, support is a vector of values and not a single value. In this paper, we present a novel approach to retrieve temporal association patterns whose prevalence values are similar to those of the user specified reference. This allows us to significantly reduce support computations by defining novel expressions to estimate support bounds. The proposed approach eliminates computational overhead in finding similar temporal patterns. We then introduce a novel dissimilarity measure, which is the fuzzy Gaussian-based dissimilarity measure. The measure also holds the monotonicity property. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms brute force and sequential approaches. We also compare the performance of the proposed approach with the SPAMINE which uses the Euclidean measure. The proposed approach uses monotonicity property to prune temporal patterns without computing unnecessary true supports and distances.","Temporal association pattern,Monotonicity,Outliers,Similar,Prevalence",,,,2016-11-18

Mining temporal patterns from these databases requires choosing and applying similarity measure for pruning patterns after computing similarity degree. This paper proposes a new z-space based similarity measure KRISHNA SUDARSANA for time-stamped transaction databases. Applying KRISHNA SUDARSANA requires moving the threshold value given by user to a different transformation space (z-space) and is a function of standard deviation. A new expression for standard deviation is derived for use in the expression for similarity measure. This research extends the similarity measure SRIHASS by using a product based membership function.,"Temporal data mining; proposing KRISHNA SUDARSANA, a z-space based similarity measure for time-stamped transaction databases, utilizing a user-defined threshold in a transformed space with standard deviation and extending SRIHASS with a product-based membership function.",,,,2018-06-19

A pattern is temporally similar when it satisfies subset constraints. The naive and apriori algorithm designed for non-temporal databases cannot be extended to find similar temporal patterns from temporal databases. The brute force approach requires computing 2^n true support combinations for ‘n’ items from finite item set and falls in NP-class. The apriori or fp-tree based approaches are not directly extendable to temporal databases to obtain similar temporal patterns. In this present research, we come up with novel approach to discover temporal association patterns which are similar for pre-specified subset constraints, and substantially reduce support computations by defining expressions to estimate support bounds.

In this paper, we discover the temporal patterns which are of interest to the user by estimating support bound sequences of temporal patterns and then using these support sequences to estimate distance bounds with respect reference of interest. The distance measure chosen is Euclidean. Since Euclidean distance does not consist upper bound, we normalize the distance to make it feasible between bounds 0 and 1. The approach yields similar temporal patterns as that of conventional association patterns which requires multiple scans. In the best case, a single scan is sufficient however, in the worst; it is required to obtain true supports for some of the patterns.

Data Imputation is normally done to fill one or more missing data attribute values. Imputation helps to perform supervised or un-supervised learning after the dataset is free from missing data. Learning process helps the discovery of hidden, valuable and important information that can provide insightful results. Imputation is a data pre-processing task that requires applying distance function to find missing values. In this paper, a distance function named MANTRA is proposed to impute missing data values. The distance function is also called as the imputation measure since it is designed for imputation of missing values. A working example is demonstrated that shows how imputation is achieved using proposed distance function, MANTRA. It is proved that the nominal value that is filled after imputation is same as the original.","Medical records, missing values, data imputation, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, hidden information, data pre-processing, distance function, MANTRA, imputation measure, working example, nominal value, original value.",,,VRK-C075,2018-10-01

Mathura Bai, N. Mangathayaru, B. Padmaja Rani, and Shadi Aljawarneh [4], proposes an imputation measure for filling missing data values to make the incomplete medical datasets as complete datasets. Then the approach is to apply this imputation measure on imputed datasets to achieve improved classifier accuracies. The basic intention of the research study is to present an imputation measure to find the proximity between medical records and an approach for imputation of missing values in medical datasets to improve the accuracy of existing classifiers. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to existing approaches with respect to classifier accuracy and also by performing a non-parametric test called the Wilcoxon test.  The second article, “E-mail Fraud Attack Detection Using Hybrid Machine Learning Approach,” is written by Yousef A. Yaseen, Malik Qasaimeh, Raad S. Al-Qassas, and Mustafa Al-Fayoumi [5]. E-mail is an efficient way to communicate. It is one of the most commonly used communication methods, and it can be used for achieving legitimate and illegitimate activities. Many features that can be effective in detecting e-mail fraud attacks are still under investigation. This paper proposes an improved classification accuracy for fraudulent e-mails implemented through feature extraction and hybrid Machine Learning (ML) classifier that combines Adaboost and Majority Voting. Eleven machine learning classifiers are evaluated experimentally within the hybrid classifier. The performance of the e-mail fraud filtering is evaluated by using WEKA and R tool on a data set of 9298 e-mail messages. The utilized proposed e-mail features with the combination of Adaboost and Voting algorithms prove the efficiency of fraud e-mail detection  Intrusion detection systems play a key role in system security by identifying potential attacks and giving appropriate responses. As new attacks are always emerging, intrusion detection systems must adapt to these attacks. More work is continuously needed to develop and propose new methods and techniques to improve efficient and effective adaptive intrusion systems. Feature selection [1, 2, 6, 7] is one of the challenging areas that need more work because of its importance and impact on the performance of intrusion detection systems. The third article, “Intrusion Detection System for Malicious Traffic Using Evolutionary Search Algorithm” is written by Samar Al-Saqqaa, Mustafa Al-Fayoumib, Malik Qasaimehc, and Raad S. Al-Qassasb [8]. It applies an evolutionary search algorithm in feature subset selection for intrusion detection systems. The evolutionary search algorithm is applied to find the best subset of features for the intrusion detection system. The experimental study proved their approach promising to be used as a feature selection method for intrusion detection. The results showed better performance for the intrusion detection system in terms of accuracy and detection rate.  The app stores, for example, Google Play and Apple Play Store, provide a platform that allows users to provide feedback on the apps in the form of reviews. An app review typically includes a star rating followed by a comment. Recent studies have shown that these reviews possess a vital source of information that can be used by the app developers and vendors for improving the future versions of an app. However, in most cases, these reviews are present in unstructured form, and extracting useful information from them requires a great effort. The fourth article, “An Optimized Classification of Apps Reviews for Improving Requirement Engineering” is written by MPS Bhatia, Akshi Kumar, and Rohit Beniwal [9]. It provides an optimized classification approach that automatically classifies the reviews into a bug report, feature request, shortcoming, and improvement request relevant to requirement engineering. The optimized automatic classification improves the requirement engineering where the developer straightforwardly knows what to improve further in the concerned app.","Imputation measure, medical datasets, classifier accuracy, Wilcoxon test, e-mail fraud detection, hybrid Machine Learning, Adaboost, Majority Voting, intrusion detection systems, evolutionary search algorithm, feature subset selection, app reviews, requirement engineering, classification, bug report, feature request, shortcoming, improvement request.",,,,2021-01-29

It eliminates the physical infrastructure of resources, which makes it a popular. Sundry schemes predicated on the attribute-predicated encryption have been suggested for providing security in cloud storage systems. However, most work fixates on the information contents secrecy and the access control, while less care is paid to the privilege control and the individuality secrecy. In this paper, we present a semi incognito privilege control scheme AnonyControl to address not only the information secrecy, but adscititiously the utilizer individuality secrecy in subsisting access control schemes. AnonyControl decentralizes the central ascendancy to inhibit the individuality leakage and thus achieves semi anonymity. Besides, it supplementally establishes the file access control with the privilege control. There the privileges of all operations on the cloud information. This can be managed in a fragile manner. Finally, we introduce the AnonyControl-F, which plenarily averts the individuality leakage and achieve the full anonymity. Our aegis analysis shows that both AnonyControl and AnonyControl-F are secured under the decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman posit, and our functioning evaluation exhibits the feasibility of our schemes. We have also implemented revocation of users which plays a vital role in cloud computing organisations.","Cipher text–policy, attribute based encryption, Anony Scheme, Privilege Tree, Key Exchange.",,,,2016-09-01

The model is designed on variant testing criteria ranging from 10% to 50%. These models are evaluated on gold-standard classification measures. To study the performance, testing samples were expanded by 5x (i.e., from 10% to 50%) and it is found that the deviation in the accuracy was quite low (0.27%) which resembles the consistent generalization ability. Finally, the larger model obtained an accuracy score of 94.98% for 38 distinct classes.",Bilinear convolution neural networks (Bi-CNN’s); plant disease classification; mobile API; deep learning; neural networks,,,,2021-08-03

Therefore, a business tolerance for payment fraud may be operation of, among different things, its margin of profit (sell value - value of products sold). The lower the margin, the lower the tolerance for payment fraud. In observance, once fraud happens, the cardholder disputes the charge and also the debit is typically off, which suggests either the cardholders bank or the bourgeois absorbs the loss (see Aleskerov, E., Freisleben, B., Rao, B.: Cardwatch: a neural network- based database mining system for credit card fraud detection.

Cumulatively, fraud represents a big monetary risk to the bourgeois and also the provision bank. to scale back fraud, 3D secure, fraud detection techniques, chip and pin technologies are used. However, if 3D secure and chip and pin technology exist, why is fraud detection used? There are two main reasons. First, the full value of 3D secure and chip and pin technology is comparatively high compared to the value of fraud detection. e.g., whereas online merchants care concerning conversion, 3D secure reduces it by many percent (>5%). Hence, once they have the choice, several online merchants conceive to deactivate 3D secure and manage the chance of payment fraud themselves. Second, adding additional security layers to the shopping method greatly reduces checkout rate and, in turn, convenience for the client. Whereas convenience for consumers might appear as if a fuzzy conception initially, for corporations like Amazon, that pioneered one-click checkout, its a selling argument and a method to convert and grow revenues.

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity.

Experimental results show that accuracies obtained using our approach is better compared to other approaches. In particular U2R and R2L accuracies are recorded to be very much promising. This research shows an approach which addresses the improvement in overall accuracy and also improvement in detecting R2L and U2R attack accuracies.

In the present education system performance evaluation is a big task, because of its multi-dimensional data base. Large data sets may consume time and produce less accurate results. To assess large databases an efficient datamining techniques are required to assess a student academic perfectly. There are various data mining techniques available to search appropriate record and data from large data. In the present paper a new method is proposed to evaluate student performance to analyse student achievement and future performance track. A clustering data mining technique is used to analyse large student data set. A clustering technique will boost the searching process speed and analysis. In the present work the existing techniques are discussed and presented the flaws in various contemporary techniques. Evaluating student performance would enhance the student skills, and help the educators and institutions to adopt new learning methods or modifications in the present techniques.","Data mining,Prediction algorithms,Performance evaluation,Classification algorithms,Education,Learning systems,Support vector machines",,,,2017-05-11

In this paper we tried to perform classification of processes running into normal and abnormal states by using system call behavior. We reduce the system call feature vector by choosing k-means algorithm which uses the proposed measure for dimensionality reduction. We give the design of the proposed measure. The proposed measure has upper and lower bounds which are finite.","clustering, np-complete, algorithm, literature, k-means, frequency, binary, system calls, classification, processes, normal, abnormal, dimensionality reduction, feature vector, bounds",,,,2015-09-24

In existing technique security is provided using cryptography techniques but still attackers [5] can manage to get original data by hacking keys and eavesdrop (identify and alter packet) packet [7]. Cryptography techniques require heavy computation and can be hack by attackers. To improve security author is using reluctant checksum (hash code) [4] while sending data and only destination can decode and compare data. While sending data first corrupted data will be added to message and only source and destination may know how to get original data from corrupted data and message integrity will be checked using UMAC hash code. Sender will generate checksum code and send code with message to receiver and then receiver once again generate code on received message, if same hash code generated [4] then message was not eavesdrop or alter by attacker. By adding corrupted messages attacker will have no clue to identify which part of message is original and which part is corrupted and without getting original message attacker cannot alter packet and security[6] will be improve.

Detecting arrhythmia from ECG signals is considered a standard approach and hence, automating this process would aid the diagnosis by providing fast, cost-efficient, and accurate solutions at scale. This is executed by extracting the definite properties from the individual patterns collected from Electrocardiography (ECG) signals causing arrhythmia.

Firstly, the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) method is implied to overhaul shift-invariance and aids signal reconstruction to extract significant features. Next, A neural attention mechanism is implied to capture temporal patterns from the extracted features of the ECG signal to discriminate distinct classes of arrhythmia and is trained end-to-end with the finest parameters. To ensure that the model’s generalizability, a set of five train-test variants are implied. The proposed model attains the highest accuracy of 98.5% for classifying 8 variants of arrhythmia on the MIT-BIH dataset. To test the resilience of the model, the unseen (test) samples are increased by 5x and the deviation in accuracy score and MSE was 0.12% and 0.1% respectively. Further, to assess the diagnostic model performance, AUC-ROC curves are plotted. At every test level, the proposed model is capable of generalizing new samples and leverages the advantage to develop a real-world application.

Each parser has its own method of constructing a dependency tree. This paper describes the approaches for integrating transition and graph based parsers for parsing Telugu sentences. Combining these parsers at learning time is called Stacking and, at parsing time is called Ensembling. Stacking has two levels, level-0 and level-1. In level-0 model is trained under transition approach and generates the augmented trained data, which is used in level-1. The augmented data is then trained using graph based parser in level 1. It has shown better results when compared to the base parsers. Ensembled approach uses variations in base parsers, six variations of base parsers were built, among which four parsers are taken from transition based parsers and two parsers from graph based parsers. Majority, Attardi and Eisner are the three methods of Ensembled Approach which used for evaluating the parsing results. Majority approach has outperformed comparative with Attardi and Eisner methods. Different number of parsers are used for evaluating the performance, and obtained good results with three variations of base parsers, they are Covington projective, Covington non-projective and Non-projective second order features.

Next, A neural attention mechanism is implied to capture temporal patterns from the extracted features of the ECG signal to discriminate distinct classes of arrhythmia and is trained end-to-end with the finest parameters. To ensure that the model’s generalizability, a set of five train-test variants are implied. The proposed model attains the highest accuracy of 98.5% for classifying 8 variants of arrhythmia on the MIT-BIH dataset. To test the resilience of the model, the unseen (test) samples are increased by 5x and the deviation in accuracy score and MSE was 0.12% and 0.1% respectively. Further, to assess the diagnostic model performance, AUC-ROC curves are plotted. At every test level, the proposed model is capable of generalizing new samples and leverages the advantage to develop a real-world application. As a note, this research is the first attempt to provide neural attention in arrhythmia classification using MIT-BIH ECG signals data with state-of-the-art performance.",Arrhythmia classification; arrhythmia detection; MIT-BIH dataset; dual-tree complex wave transform; ECG classification; neural attention; neural networks; deep learning,,,,2021-07-21

Our work implements KNN algorithm with a similarity measure in identifying the optimal nearest neighbours for test instances and deciding their class label as the majority class label among the nearest neighbours.

A reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is often used to detect the disease. However, since this test is time-consuming, a chest computed tomography (CT) or plain chest X-ray (CXR) is sometimes indicated. The value of automated diagnosis is that it saves time and money by minimizing human effort. Three significant contributions are made by our research. Its initial purpose is to use the essential finetuning methodology to test the action and efficiency of a variety of vision models, ranging from Inception to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) networks. Second, by plotting class activation maps (CAMs) for individual networks and assessing classification efficiency with AUC-ROC curves, the behavior of these models is visually analyzed. Finally, stacked ensembles techniques were used to provide greater generalization by combining finetuned models with six ensemble neural networks. Using stacked ensembles, the generalization of the models improved. Furthermore, the ensemble model created by combining all of the finetuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art COVID-19 accuracy detection score of 99.17%.

In addition, imputation helps us to build an effective classification model to discover hidden patterns which can provide insightful outcomes. In this paper, the normalized mean imputation approach is designed to fill the missing data value in numerical datasets. After normalizing the data, compute the mean and cube-root-of-cubic mean.

The results showed that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the existing imputation algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and also our decision tree algorithm employs highly accurate decision rules.","data mining,database management systems,decision trees,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern classification,support vector machines",,,,2012-12-18

Image denoising is still accepted as a challenge for researchers and image application developers in medical image applications. The idea is to denoise a microscopic image through over-complete dictionary learning using a k-means algorithm and singular value decomposition (K-SVD) based on pursuit methods. This approach is good in performance on the quality improvement of the medical images, but it has low computational speed with high computational complexity. In view of the above limitations, this chapter proposes a novel strategy for denoising insight phenomena of the K-SVD algorithm. In addition, the authors utilize the technology of improved dictionary learning of the image patches using heap sort mechanism followed by dictionary updating process. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach successfully reduced noise levels on various test image datasets. This has been found to be more accurate than the best in class denoising approaches.","denoising, medical image analysis, over-complete dictionary learning, k-svd algorithm, singular value decomposition, pursuit methods, computational speed, computational complexity, novel strategy, insight phenomena, improved dictionary learning, image patches, heap sort mechanism, dictionary updating process, test image datasets",,,,2019-09-01

If the parasite remains untreated for an extended period, it can cause serious damage, and delaying treatment can lead to coma and death. Malaria cannot be detected through a clinical diagnosis, it must be identified or ruled out by a microscopic study of blood smears. Experts examine blood smears under a microscope to help identify the parasites. The manual examination is a time consuming and challenging process. The proposed empirical study works on dynamic routing among capsule neural networks for automated malaria parasite identification and classification in blood cell images. The experimental results confirm that the capsule network model designed in this present work renders the accurate classification of blood cell images as opposed to different deep learning networks. This achievement may be attributed to the utilization of swish activation function and this aspect is missing in other studies. Also, it is worthy to note the present methodology depicts 99.72% accuracy rate in the detection of malaria parasites in thin blood cell images. From the findings of the present study, we conclude that the proposed capsule network methodology is a promising tool for malaria classification. Also, it is interesting to note when it comes to rapid malaria diagnosis, the proposed method outperforms conventional methodologies.","Blood Cell images, Capsule Networks, Dynamic Routing, Malaria.",,,,2021-03-26

Malaria is a severe infectious disease that is caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Manual identification of parasites in microscopic blood image examination remains common, but assessment exactness usually depends on the clinical expert’s understanding. Such systems include a radical error in terms of subjectivity, which prompts to less diagnostic accuracy. To increase diagnostic precision, modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies play a vital role in battling infectious diseases. Objective. This research aims to increase diagnostic precision, minimizing subjectivity, and improve robustness toward malaria parasite detection. Methods. In modernized diagnostic model development, artificial intelligence methods have huge contributions for attaining robust diagnostic precision in microscopic images. Considering this, our study aims at the advancement of a machine learning-based diagnostic model. Results. It is observed, the performance of various machine learning methods like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, CART, SVM, k-NN, Random Forest (RF) is tested on the malaria dataset. Experiment results have shown that the Random forest classifier provides competency outcomes with significance toward malaria detection. The models are evaluated with classifier performance estimates like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Conclusions. This research presents the machine learning-based diagnostic model for malaria parasite detection and it increases diagnostic precision and improves robustness toward malaria parasite detection for a better understanding of test samples.","Color histogram,Descriptors,Feature extraction,Hu moments,Haralick,Malaria,Microscopic images,Random forest,SURF",,,,2021-11-16

To shorten the morbidity of malaria, accurate and fast diagnostic tools are to be implied with Artificial Intelligence. In this research, an automated, fast, and accurate diagnostic model for one-shot detection and classification of malaria thin blood smears were developed using the Deep Siamese Capsule Network (D-SCN) and contributions for our research are threefold. Firstly, we proposed the D-SCN model which consists of two crucial phases which are feature extraction and feature discrimination. Secondly, we implied an end-to-end trained capsule network with an imperative routing (IR) mechanism for the feature extraction phase to capture feature invariances. Finally, at the feature discrimination phase, Lorentz, L1 and L2 similarity metrics were proposed for the dissimilation of features. During experimentation, it is observed that the Lorentz similarity metric provided more discriminative capability by acquiring the least MSE at most of the instances. Further, an algorithm is proposed to obtain faster convergence by cautiously tuning the hyperparameters, and this aided in decreasing the noise scale in training the D-SCN. The experimental outcomes proved that D-SCN outperformed with the highest detection accuracy of 97.24% for Lorentz as a similarity measure, and the Capsule network with IR mechanism outperformed with the highest classification accuracy of 98.89%. To our knowledge, the proposed research implications are the first applications of D-SCN for one-shot detection and classification of thin blood smears with state-of-the-art performance.","Deep Siamese capsule network,Neural network,Machine learning,Malaria parasites detection,Deep learning",,,,2022-04-21

Variant neural architectures have been proposed over the past decade with increasing depth, width, and channels for precise feature extraction. In images, feature extraction is a crucial step. The CNN will be able to extract the spatial information, but they can't retrieve the spatial orientations of the entities residing in the image. Further, attention to the required features is not seen. These points are considered challenges, and a neural architecture is to be constructed by overhauling these loops. Hence, we propose an attention block which can be easily embedded into standard convolution neural networks and eventually outperforms the plain CNN on CIFAR-10 and the NIH Malaria Data Set.

We first describe the importance of this constraint considering machine translation systems which use dependency parser output, as an example application. We then show how the current state-of-the-art dependency parsers violate this constraint. We describe two methods to handle this constraint.

FACTS Controllers are most effective devices to ensure system security by enhancing the stability margins with reactive power support all over the power system network. The major shunt compensation devices of FACTS are SVC and STATCOM. This article dispenses the modelling and simulation of both the shunt devices viz. Oneis the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and the other is Static Var Compensator (SVC). The small signal models of these devices have been derived from the first principles and obtained the transfer function models of weak and strong power systems. The weak power system has the Short Circuit Ratio (SCR) is about less than 3 and that of the strong power system has the SCR of more than 5. The performance of the both weak and strong power systems has been evaluated with time and frequency responses. The dynamic response is obtained with the exact models for both weak and strong systems, subsequently the root locus plots as well as bode plots have been obtained with MATLAB Programs and evaluated the performance of these devices and comparison is made. The Stability margins of both the systems with SVC and STATCOM have been obtained from the bode plots. The dynamic behaviour of the both kinds of power systems have been assessed with time responses of SVC and STATCOM models. All of these results viz. dynamic response, root locus and bode plots proves the superiority of the STATCOM over SVC with indices, viz. peak overshoot, settling time, gain margin and phase margins. The dynamic, steady state performance indices obtained from time response and bode plots proves the superior performance of STATCOM.","Performance evaluation,Analytical models,Power system dynamics,Stability criteria,Static VAr compensators,Transfer functions,Power system stability",,,,2022-03-25

In this work, a new fuzzy membership function to detect anomalies and intrusions and a method for dimensionality reduction is proposed. CANN could not address R2L and U2R attacks and have completely failed by showing these attack accuracies almost zero. Following CANN, the CLAPP approach has shown better classifier accuracies when compared to classifiers kNN, and SVM. This research aims at improving the accuracy achieved by CLAPP, CANN, and kNN. Experimental results show accuracies obtained using proposed approach is better when compared to other existing approaches.

Traditionally IDSs (Intrusion detection systems) have been developed by applying machine learning techniques and adopted single learning mechanism. This is later extended by developing Intrusion Detection Systems by adopting multiple learning mechanisms. Such systems have addressed better detection rates compared to single learning Intrusion Detection Systems. Dimensionality is one more serious concern which affects the performance of classification algorithms. Approaches such as ""Feature selection"" have been studied and adopted which selects a subset features from the feature set. However, the feature extraction approach for dimensionality reduction has proved to be better compared to feature selection and achieved better classification and detection rates. In this research, we address ""Feature extraction"" using ""Evolutionary feature clustering"" by proposing a ""Novel fuzzy membership function"" which addresses Dimensionality Reduction (DR). The idea is to transform the initial connection representation so that its equivalent representation has reduced noise affect and achieves better classification or detection rates. Experimental results on KDD datasets with 19 and 41 attributes, prove that the proposed approach has improved detection rates for R2L and U2R attack classes when compared to CANN, CLAPP, and SVM approaches. CANN approach recorded lower detection rates w.r.t U2R and R2L attacks. This failure is addressed in our earlier studies through proposing, CLAPP which proved comparatively better accuracy rates to CANN.

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure.

The dissimilarity measure is also applied to achieve evolutionary clustering and dimensionality reduction of system calls. Earlier works in evolutionary clustering used basic Gaussian membership function to incrementally cluster by randomly assuming the initial deviation. This work aims at achieving evolutionary clustering by defining the expression to choose, initial deviation by eliminating the need to assume the standard deviation. Finally classification may also be performed using the proposed dissimilarity measure.","Intrusion detection,Dimensionality reduction,Training,Clustering algorithms,Testing,Classification algorithms,Standards",,,GRK-CPUB-017,2017-05-08

Achieving better accuracies by applying benchmark classifier algorithms used for identifying intrusions and anomalies have several hidden data mining challenges. Although neglected by many research findings, one of the most important and biggest challenges is the similarity or membership computation. Another challenge that cannot be simply neglected is the number of features that attributes to dimensionality. This research aims to come up with a new membership function to carry similarity computation that can be helpful for addressing feature dimensionality issues. In principle, this work is aimed at introducing a novel membership function that can help to achieve better classification accuracies and eventually lead to better intrusion and anomaly detection. Experiments are performed on KDD dataset with 41 attributes and also KDD dataset with 19 attributes. Recent approaches CANN and CLAPP have showed new approaches for intrusion detection. The proposed classifier is named as UTTAMA. UTTAMA performed better to both CANN and CLAPP approaches w.r.t overall classifier accuracy. Another promising outcome achieved using UTTAMA is the U2R and R2L attack accuracies. The importance of proposed approach is that the accuracy achieved using proposed approach outperforms CLAPP, CANN, SVM, KNN and other existing classifiers.","Anomaly,Intrusion,Classifier,Outlier,Clustering,Dimensionality,Feature extraction",,,GRK-JPUB-019,2019-03-05

For example, anomalies and attacks in IoT environment such as scan, malicious operation, denial of service, spying, data type probing, wrong setup, malicious control can lead to failure of an IoT system. Datasets generated in an IoT environment usually have missing values. The presence of missing values makes the classifier unsuitable for classification task. This article introduces (a) a novel imputation technique for imputation of missing data values (b) a classifier which is based on feature transformation to perform classification (c) imputation measure for similarity computation between any two instances that can also be used as similarity measure. The performance of proposed classifier is studied by using imputed datasets obtained through applying Kmeans, F-Kmeans and proposed imputation methods. Experiments are also conducted by applying existing and proposed classifiers on the imputed dataset obtained using proposed imputation technique. For experimental study in this article, we have used an open source dataset named distributed smart space orchestration system publicly available from Kaggle. Experiment results obtained are also validated using Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. It is proved that the performance of proposed approach is better when compared to existing classifiers when the imputation process is performed using F-Kmeans and K-Means imputation techniques. It is also observed that accuracies for attack classes scan, malicious operation, denial of service, spying, data type probing, wrong setup are 100% while it is 99% for malicious control attack class when the proposed imputation and classification technique are applied.","anomaly detection, attack detection, iot environment, missing values, imputation technique, classifier, feature transformation, similarity measure, kmeans, f-kmeans, imputed datasets, experimental study, open source dataset, performance, statistical test",,,GRK-JPUB-023,2020-04-13

This protocol structure is almost as same as HTTP Protocol, i.e., for every request there will be some response, even though the request is invalid. HTTP Protocol is prone to flooding attacks, like SYN-Flood attack. Because of SIP is same as HTTP, SIP is also prone to Flooding attacks.

This application will help in the reduction of accidents and help make the lives of blind people just a little easier. The findings appear to provide good evidence that using widely accessible dense building blocks to approximate the predicted ideal sparse structure is a feasible technique for enhancing neural networks for computer vision. There are two more advantages to this architecture: One is that the number of units in each step is greatly increased, yet the computational complexity is kept under control. A significant number of input filters can be shielded from the final step to the next layer when dimensionality reduction is used widely. Second, visual data is processed on several scales and then aggregated so that the following phase may extract characteristics from many scales at the same time.

This research proposes an improved imputation approach called IM-CBC (Imputation based on class-based clustering) and a classifier termed as the Class-Based-Clustering Classifier(CBCC-IM). Experiments are performed on nine benchmark datasets and the recorded results using IM-CBC imputation approach are compared to ten imputation approaches using classifiers KNN, SVM and C4.5 and to the CBCC classifier using Euclidean distance and fuzzy gaussian similarity functions. Results obtained prove that the performance of classifiers is improved or atleast nearer to the existing approaches.

The solar panels can harvest a maximum amount of energy only if the rays are exactly perpendicular to the surface of the panels.

In this approach, we impute each missing data attribute value by predicting its data value from non-missing data attributes. The experiments are conducted on benchmark medical datasets missing values ranging from 1.98% to 50.65% and compared with iterative imputation, KNN imputation, and missForest imputation.

Precognitive diagnoses are characterized by lightheadedness, nausea, severe fatigue, and an elevated heart rate. As a result, it’s important to seek care as soon as possible after experiencing syncope. Since receiving a correct diagnosis and appropriate care, the majority of patients may avoid complications with syncope. Syncope appears to be a sign of COVID 19 in people with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, a sudden heart attack might result in acute syncope.

Recently, Xiaoqin Shen,proposed a new CL-S scheme, which he claimed was the first CL-S that is strongly unforgeable without the use of random oracles, i.e., in the standard model. Although he claimed that his scheme has stronger security than the previous scheme, his scheme is not secure against the key replacement attack. Moreover, Shen?s CL-S scheme is insecure against a malicious-butpassive KGC attack In this research work, however, it will bepointed out that Shen?s scheme is insecure against public key replacement attack (PKRA) and malicious-but-passive KGC attack (MKGCA). Furthermore, an improved scheme has been proposed that overcomes has shortcomings in his scheme due to security flaws while at the same time, improving upon the merits of the original scheme. It not only preserves the advantages of Shen?s scheme such as shorter system parameters and higher computational efficiency than the existing related works, but also improves the efficiency of Shen?s schemes by reducing the signature size.

To achieve the full security, existing schemes suffers a security degradation exponential in the hierarchy depth. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption with maximum hierarchy extension to Boneh IBE under Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption in standard security model. To overcome key escrow problem challenge in HIBE, we proposed a new method that overcomes key escrow by having maximum Hierarchy length.

Due to the continuous motion of the node, handoffs between different APs are necessary to remain connected. This work proposes a location-based handoff method which will minimize handoff latency and provide better connections. The location-based handoff mechanism uses the concept of placing an access point (AP) at the predetermined locations. Handoff is triggered at the location where the AP (access point) is located and a connection is made to the new AP based on the channel information obtained. The architecture used in this scenario is WiMAX architecture and connections are maintained with the help of routers contained within the mobile stations.

In-order to improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication mechanisms we involve multiple servers to store the passwords and participate in key-exchange and authentication process so as to ensure that even a single server is compromised the whole system’s security is not in threat and also generating a nonce values randomly for every session corresponds to a two level security mechanism where the scope of an attacker to pretend as the legitimate user and login into the system is completely restricted. In this model the passwords are stored in their equivalent hash values and they are spitted into multiple servers. Making it even more difficult for the attacker to determine the password even by reverse engineering he cannot intercept the actual password form segments of hash value. Hence, we can present this model as safe and secure password based authentication scheme using key exchange mechanism.","Authentication, Cryptography, Key exchange.

Some real-world applications involve items of different nature, whose significance is measured using different criteria such as utility, risk, profit, weight, time duration, etc. In addition to the utility of items constituting a pattern, the significance of a pattern is also influenced by its occupancy in its supporting sequences. To deal with the above problems, we propose a variant of SPM called high utility-occupancy sequential pattern mining(HUOSPM) to discover more interesting, potentially useful, and dominant patterns. In this paper, the authors devised two compact data structures called seqlist to represent information about each sequence of the quantitative sequence dataset and uolist to maintain candidate patterns information. The authors proposed a novel utility-occupancy framework based HUOSPM algorithm, which discovers the patterns using seqlist and uolist. The authors also proposed search space pruning strategies called pattern extension utility-occupancy, reduced sequence utility-occupancy, and extension upper bound utility-occupancy. Experimentation was carried out on real datasets with varying support threshold and utility occupancy threshold to evaluate the quality of patterns. It is observed from results that the patterns generated by our proposed HUOSPM algorithm are qualitative compared to baseline algorithm prefix span and also it can completely discover HUOSP’s","Data mining, Pattern discovery, PatternGrowth, Utility-Occupancy, Variant sequential patterns",,,,2021-04-01

Each sequence in sequence dataset is composed of time ordered events and each event is an item set. It discovers all frequent subsequences having frequency greater than the given minimum support threshold. Discovering sequential patterns is expensive with respect to mining time as well as the amount of memory used, because of aggressive search space growth due to generation of explosive number of frequent subsequences with the sequence length as well as count of distinct items and large volume of sequence dataset. So, research in this domain aims at developing effective data structures which address frequency counting and large search space as well as scalable algorithms to reduce the execution time and the amount of memory utilized. We propose two efficient data structures called Pre-order Post-order Coded Aggregate Tree (PPCA-Tree) for compact representation of the sequence dataset and Root-node List of First-Occurrence Sub Trees Map (RLFOST-Map) for efficient representation of projected databases. We also developed an efficient Partially ordered Sequential PAttern Mining algorithm called PSPAM and Parallel implementation of Partially ordered Sequential PAttern Mining algorithm called PAPSPAM based on PPCA-Tree using RLFOST-Map which eliminates reconstruction of the projecteddatabases. Experimental analysis done on various synthetic datasets proves that our algorithms PSPAM and PAPSPAM outperform prefixspan and other conventional & state-of-the-art algorithms over dense datasets with better scalability.","Data mining, Pattern-growth, Sequential patterns,

So, instead of searching directly using keyword here in this paper the approach is different. Here, I am using searching over the encrypted data which is much secure than the normal searching. In this project, I will be using AES encryption algorithm for encryption and Jaccard coefficient to find the similarity between the keywords. So after giving keyword, the encrypted keywords can be searched and user will be able to find the file over cloud. In this project, I have implemented and tested the solution to the problem of secure cloud computing. By using the fuzzy keyword searching over encrypted cloud computing and taking care of safety and secrecy of data files. This fuzzy keyword searching significantly increases the efficiency and safety over cloud. This is user friendly and easy to manage and require less resource. And the results are accurate enough to get exact files searched by the user. The efficiency is increased by approximated computing and it works great. In this solution, Jaccard coefficient is being used to calcite similarity and used two advanced techniques to make fuzzy keyword set, which achieves the great results. Where n-gram algorithm is used to generate the set of different length n-grams of any keyword which is going to be encrypted and is being stored over cloud.

For this to be achieved, attackers usually stagger the network bandwidth, halting system resources, thus causing denial of access for legitimate users.

Understanding nature of traffic instances in network datasets helps to build efficient machine learning models. For building a machine learning model, we choose to apply regression analysis. Two datasets namely CICIDS 2017 and CICIDS 2019 are considered for the present study as these datasets show high non-linearity.

Regardless, while  remains compulsory for any application endeavoring to adjust to enormous measures of data, simply part of the capacity of today's Big data chronicles can be mishandled using conventional batch oriented methodologies as the estimation of data routinely decays rapidly and high latency gets the chance to be prohibited in a couple of uses. The high volume and velocity of data has to be analyzed and processed while moving within the stream of data. The interest for stream processing is expanding a great deal nowadays.

Due to the large location of computing devices, the large volume of information is increasingly growing in the recent decades. A main role of big data is that a large set of data enables the machine learning techniques to obtain more accurate and better results. As the amount of data is exploding, it raises more challenges and opportunities for data analytic research in the data mining domain. The massively parallel databases not only have storage mechanisms but also have compute platforms. The extra capacity in the databases to really put some algorithms and move the data into in-memory to solve the problems. However, the big data stream contains different characteristics, such as high dimensionality, sparsity, volume and velocity. These characteristic features pose huge issues for the classification process when employing traditional data stream classification methods. For huge collection of data, effectively selecting the features and then classifying the data is important to make patterns. Recent feature selection strategies are involving the use of optimization methods for picking a subset of important features to get good classification results. Therefore, in this case study the feature selection is performed based on the Dragonfly Moth Search (DMS) optimization. The performance of the classification method is carried out in two different phases, such as offline and online phase by considering the master and slave node with stacked auto encoder (SAE) in the spark architecture.

Accordingly, this paper introduces a technique based on optimization for handling the concept drift effectively. The proposed dragonfly moth search (DMS) algorithm-based spark architecture is developed for handling the big data stream classification without any concept drift. Specifically, big data stream classification is done based on the proposed DMS-based stacked auto-encoder (SAE) in spark and the big data stream classification involves two phases, namely online phase and offline phase. The incremental data is tackled effectively in the online phase, where the concept drift is checked based on error, and in case of any concept drift, the rough set theory is employed, which is defined, based on DMS algorithm.

The business data analysis techniques allows to find the customers data and produce analysis reports helps to implement best policies in a business environment. On the other hand, business intelligence (BI) tools ensure to predict and analyse the historical data with the current data, to predict the events of a business operation. Thismethod seems to be more complex due to the involvement of large data from the millions of the customers. Using the data mining techniques along with DM and BI, the data can be processed effectively so as to deliver accurate decisions. In this work, application of customer leaving in the telecom industry is tested for prediction of customer behaviour using data mining techniques. Large number of data sets will be process from the telecom industry by introducing a unique method by combining hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as HGAPSO, which allows extracting specific and useful data. By using the advantages of both the methods, one can accurately determine the decisions from the customer churn predictions using auxiliary vector classification method. The performance metrics in this work considered accuracy, true positive response rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), time complexity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results from this work delivered high scalability using HGAPSO and well suited for predictions in the area of business analysis","CRM, BI, DM systems, Attribute Selection,

In this work, a unique system is built to reveal the information of the image based on its category and relevant labels associated with it. To accomplish this task different data mining techniques are used for image classifications using Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm is constructed with the help of grey level features and along with some of the colour features. Grey level features include speed up robust features (SURF), maximum stable external regions (MESR) and improved colour coherence vector (ICCV). Apart from that different techniques involved in data mining are being used includes neural networks (NN), decision trees (DT), Bayesian networks (BN), discriminant analysis (DA) and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). These techniques are used to evaluate the datasets included with Corel-1000 and COIL-100. BN and DA outperformed other methods as they are achieved a specificity of 99.9%, sensitivity of 99.5% and accuracy of 99.4% for Coral-1000.

Software-defined networks (SDN) use edge computing for IoT devices. The disruptive quality of SDN allows the management of network nodes using a software program from a remote location, making them more effective than a traditional system. However, edge computing allows a massive number of devices at the edge for communicating with the SDN. Traditional networks are unable to handle the increasing number of mobile devices and other peripherals required to process big data. The elastic nature of SDN-enabled edge computing to deal with IoT makes it more significant as a norm for dealing with robust events, activities and data. This chapter discusses a detailed SDN-based IoT architecture with edge computing that offers a successful and robust environment to deal with billions of devices in a meaningful and secured manner.

In recent times many algorithms have been proposed for mining high utility itemsets ,but most of them follow a two- phase horizontal approach in which candidate itemsets are generated first and then the actual high utility itemsets are mined by performing another database scan. This approach generates a large number of candidate itemsets which are not actual high utility itemsets thus causing memory and time overhead to process them. To overcome this problem we propose a single phase algorithm which uses vertical database approach. Exhaustive search can mine all the high utility itemsets but it is expensive and time consuming. Two strategies based on u-list structure and item pair co- existence map are used in this algorithm for efficiently pruning the search space to avoid exhaustive search. Experimental analysis over various databases show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the two-phase algorithms UP-Growth, UP-Growth+ and IHUP in terms of running times and memory consumption."," high utility itemset mining, downward closure property, frequent itemset mining, horizontal approach, candidate itemsets, actual high utility itemsets, database scan, single phase algorithm, vertical database approach, exhaustive search, u-list structure, item pair co-existence map, pruning the search space, experimental analysis, memory consumption",,,,2016-12-05

The conventional trend is to get the product to the nearest warehouse after it is ordered or stock the warehouses to their full capacity to cater to customer demands. Those methods are ineffective because if the product is called after it is ordered it will lead to a waiting time of a couple of days, also special transportation needs to be arranged to get a less number of parcels to the destination which raises costs and pollution. Stocking up of warehouses is also ineffective as you waste space that could have been used for other products but also the products that no one needs have to be sent back which doubles the transportation cost.

A lot of factors can be considered while designing a movie recommendation system like the genre of the movie, actors present in it or even the director of the movie. The systems can recommend movies based on one or a combination of two or more attributes.

It can be achieved in several ways, one of which is to select the optimal route for data transfer. IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a standardized routing protocol for IoT. The RPL changes its path frequently while transmitting the data from source to the destination, due to high data traffic in dense networks. Hence, it creates data traffic across the nodes in the networks. To solve this issue, we propose Energy and Delay Aware Data aggregation in Routing Protocol (EDADA-RPL) for IoT. It has two processes, namely parent selection and data aggregation. The process of parent selection uses routing metric residual energy (RER) to choose the best possible parent for data transmission. The data aggregation process uses the compressed sensing (CS) theory in the parent node to combine data packets from the child nodes. Finally, the aggregated data transmits from a downward parent to the sink. The sink node collects all the aggregated data and it performs the reconstruction operation to get the original data of the participant node. The simulation is carried out using the Contiki COOJA simulator.

This work proposes a location-based handoff method which will minimize handoff latency and provide better connections. The location-based handoff mechanism uses the concept of placing an access point (AP) at the predetermined locations. Handoff is triggered at the location where the AP (access point) is located and a connection is made to the new AP based on the channel information obtained. The architecture used in this scenario is WiMAX architecture and connections are maintained with the help of routers contained within the mobile stations.

The user can make use of cloud services through broker. But since the job initialization is dynamic the concepts like scheduling of jobs and task management is of crucial importance. The main reason is that the users can request the use of same resources at a time. Thus, managing the resources over the requests is important so that all users can access the resources. Although generic scheduling techniques like FCFS or priority scheduling are available in many ways they fall short in they’re purposeless, due to their own disadvantages. The algorithms have higher waiting time and high turnaround time, which is not that efficient when the number of jobs in cloud environments is very large. Here a hybrid of shortest job first and priority based Scheduling is used and implemented in a cloud environment and analyzed. The conclusions are noted down and they are promising enough. The average waiting time and turnaround time are greatly reduced and highly increased the efficiency of cloud management of resources. Cloud computing includes an online exchange of data, resources, and information, where the users are in constant need of resources. This causes congestion of network, starvation or at worst case a deadlock.

So there is a requirement of appropriate scheduling of tasks which will help to manage the escalating costs of data intensive applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses particle swarm optimization to schedule the tasks to get maximum benefits from the resources. The benefit can be expressed in terms of increased resource usage, minimized response time, minimize overall cost incurred.

Although, the decryption of information encrypted by using the widely known algorithms proves to a NP-hard process, evidences reveal that decryption (the process of converting encrypted string back to original string, or, successfully cracking the encryption technique) might be slow but it is not unachievable. The necessity to secure the vast amount of information related to a person or an organization, disposal of which might be catastrophic, has given rise to Encryption. Since, the majority of data resides on the cloud, it has become increasingly necessary to make it hectic for a person to breach the security of a cloud. One such algorithm is md5, which is widely used by institutions to encrypt the information residing on their cloud. However, studies have proved that it takes about 2 to the power of 64 values to be encrypted by md5 which can result in a collision, i.e., two or more information strings having the same md5 hash value. Due to the possibility of a security breach, the terms like Salt and Pepper have come into existence. Salt is a string which is unique for each information piece in the database. However, for security purpose, the salt is usually stored in a separate cloud. The information provided by the user is arranged in combination with the salt, on which the md5 algorithm is applied, and the information is then stored in the database. The usage of salt ensures that to decrypt the information, the hacker needs to deduce the salt for the information piece, followed by figuring out the combination in which the information and the salt is arranged, followed by the multiple md5 hashes of the resultant string, which is then used as password. Pepper is another string which is not unique for all information pieces. Also, it is not directly stored in the database. Instead, it is stored in the application itself. This further increases the bulk of computation for the hacker to decrypt the password. The hacker now needs to figure out the pepper, (which is not directly accessible from the database), along with breaching the database for md5 hashed information and its corresponding salt (residing on a different server/cloud)."," Data Center Carbon Footprint Computation,Data Enter Design, Energy Efficiency of Data Enter,Energy Efficient Metrics",,,SRS-JPUB-010,2019-01-05

This approach may create an additional delay for the initial packets of the flow entry that lead to more prediction error.

Routing plays a vital role in IoT to extend the lifespan of the network. Routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) is a standard routing protocol in IoT. The parent selection is a crucial role in the routing process to exchange the data. In RPL, the researchers have introduced a single metric, composite metric, and multiobjective optimization algorithm for parent selection. However, the improper parent selection causes the packet losses, congestion among the network nodes, depletes more energy, and increases the convergence time. To overcome these issues, this article proposes energy efficient optimal parent selection in RPL (EEOPS-RPL) using firefly optimization algorithm to extend the lifespan of the IoT network. In EEOPS-RPL, each node in the network is considered to be firefly and also calculates the current location of firefly, attraction of the fireflies, random function, velocity, and the global best values in the network. Residual energy and expected transmission count are attractiveness parameters and distance is a movement parameter to choose the optimum parent in the destination-oriented directed acyclic graph for data transmission. The simulation is conducted using COOJA. The EEOPS-RPL provides better performance in comparison to the efficient parent selection for RPL (EPC-RPL) and the E-RPL. The EEOPS-RPL improves the packet transmission ratio and lifespan of the network by 2% to 5%, and 5% to 10%, respectively, compared with EPC-RPL and E-RPL.In EEOPS-RPL, each participant node applies the firefly algorithm over the parent node information such as distance, residual energy, and expected transmission count through DODAG information object control message to pick the best parent node in the DODAG. The firefly algorithm provides the fast convergence that able to choose the optimal parent quickly. Thus, it avoids the packet loss during the route establishment in network. Thus, EEOPS-RPL extends the lifespan of the network and reduces the convergence time.","energy conservation, internet of things (iot), routing protocol, low-power and lossy networks, rpl (routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks), parent selection, composite metric, multiobjective optimization algorithm, firefly optimization algorithm, residual energy, expected transmission count, destination-oriented directed acyclic graph, cooja, packet transmission ratio, convergence time",,,SRS-JPUB-037,2020-08-04

Food demand is rising day by day as a result of population growth. Existing farming techniques are not suited for increasing food production. To overcome this issue, we use Internet of Things (IoT), which is one of the emerging technologies in the agriculture field. Generally, the IoT devices consist of low power, low processing and low memory capacity. So, energy plays a significant role in extending the lifespan of the network in the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT). To increase the lifetime of the network, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Grid-based Data Aggregation Scheme in Routing (EGDAS-RPL) protocol for AIoT. It has three processes, namely grid formation, grid head (GH) selection and grid head parent selection. First, EGDAS-RPL forms the equal-sized grid on the square network. Second, it probabilistically selects the GH node within the grid. Finally, it considers the metric expected transmission count (ETX) to select the optimal GH parent for data transfer. The simulation is conducted using the COOJA simulator. The performance of the proposed EGDAS-RPL protocol is compared to RPL and E2HRC-RPL, which reduces the packet loss ratio and end-to-end delay. Thus, EGDAS-RPL protocol increases the lifespan of the network.","agriculture, food production, economic growth, population growth, farming techniques, internet of things (iot), energy, agricultural internet of things (aiot), data aggregation, grid-based, routing protocol, cooja simulator, packet loss ratio, end-to-end delay, network lifespan",,,SRS-JPUB-038,2020-12-01

The simulation is conducted using the NS2 simulator. The efficacy of the SOA is compared to Improved Ant Bee Colony optimization-based Clustering (IABCOCT), Enhanced Particle Swarm optimization Technique (EPSOCT) and Hierarchical Clustering-based CH Election (HCCHE).

The controller, also called as the operating system of the SDN, is responsible for running various network applications and maintaining several network services and functionalities. Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential targets. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to the Internet. As the control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, the goal of this paper is to detect the attack traffic, by taking the centralized control aspect of SDN. Nowadays, in the field of SDN, various machine learning (ML) techniques are being deployed for detecting malicious traffic. Despite these works, choosing the relevant features and accurate classifiers for attack detection is an open question. For better detection accuracy, in this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is assisted by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed SVM model, KPCA is used for reducing the dimension of feature vectors, and GA is used for optimizing different SVM parameters. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed. The experimental results show that compared to single-SVM, the proposed model achieves more accurate classification with better generalization. Moreover, the proposed model can be embedded within the controller to define security rules to prevent possible attacks by the attackers.","DDoS attack,

However, the conventional data analysis techniques are incapable of processing this huge amount of data. For the efficient processing of high dimensional datasets, it is essential to develop some new parallel methods.Methods: In this work, a novel distributed method is presented using Map-Reduce (MR)-based approach. The proposed algorithm consists of MR-based Fisher score (mrFScore), MR-based ReliefF (mrRefiefF), and MR-based probabilistic neural network (mrPNN) using a weighted chaotic grey wolf optimization technique (WCGWO). Here, mrFScore, and mrRefiefF methods are introduced for feature selection (FS), and mrPNN is implemented as an effective method for microarray classification. The proper choice of smoothing parameter (?) plays a major role in the prediction ability of the PNN which is addressed using a novel technique namely, WCGWO. The WCGWO algorithm is used to select the optimal value of ? in PNN. Results: These algorithms have been successfully implemented using the Hadoop framework. The proposed model is tested by using three large and one small microarray datasets, and a comparative analysis is carried out with the existing FS and classification techniques. The results suggest that WCGWO-mrPNN can outperform other methods for high dimensional microarray classification. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed methods are compared with other existing schemes. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is accurate and robust. Hence, the suggested scheme is considered to be a reliable framework for microarray data analysis. Significance: Such a method promotes the application of parallel programming using Hadoop cluster for the analysis of large-scale genomics data, particularly when the dataset is of high dimension.","Fisher score, Grey wolf optimization, Hadoop, MapReduce, Probabilistic neural network, ReliefF",,,SRS-JPUB-034,2020-06-01

However, the switch migration process is a complex process that may affect the end-user quality of service (QoS), as a result, the response time of the control messages are also affected. To address this issue, the authors present RTSM, a novel strategy, that optimises the response time of the control messages during switch migration. Further, an SDWAN architecture was proposed, in which the introduction of the layer-2 controller reduces the dependency on WAN communication of the forwarding devices. The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions have been applied for target controller selection, which ensures improved response time. A switch selection method was also introduced, which minimally affects the end-user QoS during device migration in SDWAN scenario.

In EAM-RPL, the source node applies the randomised linear network coding to encode the data packets and it transmits the data packets into the next cluster level of nodes. The intermediate nodes receive the encoded data packets and forward them to the next cluster of nodes. Finally, the sink node receives the data packets and it decodes the original data packet sent by the source node. The performance of the proposed EAM-RPL is compared with the RPL protocol. The simulation result shows that the proposed EAM-RPL improves the packet delivery ratio by 3-5% and prolongs the network lifetime by 5-10%.","internet of things, network coding,IPv6 routing protocol, low power, lossy networks,multipath routing",,,SRS-JPUB-039,2020-11-01

Fraud detection is a technique of identifying fraudulent activities. We intend to apply clustering techniques in order to analyze and detect fraud or crime patterns from a large set of data. By using various clustering techniques, distinct areas or clusters can be generated by mapping crime instances (i.e., by identifying the factors that lead to fraud). These are areas which have high probability of criminal occurrences which are derived based on historical crime records. Thus, with the help of results obtained based on clustering analysis of the crime data, crime trends today can be identified. Crime can be divided into different types such as location-based crimes, theft, murder, kidnap, fraud, etc., and slums, residential areas, commercial areas, etc., are different types of areas where criminal activities may occur. Primary database is collected based on the types of crimes, the location, and the physical description of the suspects and also the time period in which felony has taken place including the other available data relevant to the analysis. The available data is then processed and clustered, thereby revealing a general crime pattern which in turn helps detect frauds.","Data mining,

Therefore, DES is one solution that can efficiently overcome the energy crisis and climate change problems. The DES, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), are incorporated to form the microgrid (MG), which are interfaced with the power system. However, interfacing MG to the power system is undoubtedly a big challenge. Therefore, more focus is required on the control strategy to control the MG with the power system. To address the PQ problems, a controlled MG integrated with a hybrid shunt active power filter (HSAPF) is provided in this work. For controlling the MG integrated HSAPF, different control strategies are applied. In this work, a learning-based incremental conductance (LINC) technique is used as a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for tracking the maximum power in PV and WT. The voltage source inverter (VSI) of HSAPF is controlled using a wavelet-based technique with a synchronous reference frame (SRF). The main focus is to improve the PQ by compensating the harmonics and regulating the reactive power in both grid-interactive and islanded condition and also supply continuous and adequate power to the non-linear load. The power system model has been developed with MATLAB/Simulink tool, which shows the efficiency of the proposed method. The results obtained have been satisfactorily under various operating conditions and can be validated further using the real-time dSPACE.","microgrid,hybrid microgrids, hybrid renewable energy system, distributed energy sources, hybrid renewable energy system, learning-based incremental conductance,harmonics, hybrid filter, power quality, total harmonic distortions",,,SRS-JPUB-041,2020-08-12

IoT devices are incredibly resource-constrained and possess miniature power sources, small memory, and limited processing ability. Clustering is a popular method to avoid duplicate data transfer from the participant node to the destination. The selection of the cluster head (CH) plays a crucial role in gathering and aggregating the data from the cluster members and forwarding the data to the sink node. The inefficient CH selection causes packet failures during the data transfer and early battery depletion nearer to the sink. This paper proposes a cluster tree-based routing protocol (CT-RPL) to increase the life span of the network and avoid the data traffic among the network nodes. The CT-RPL involves three processes, namely cluster formation, cluster head selection, and route establishment. The cluster is formed based on the Euclidean distance. The CH selection is accomplished using a game theoretic approach. Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER), queue utilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX). The simulation is carried out by using a COOJA simulator. The efficiency of a CT-RPL is compared with the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) and energy-efficient heterogeneous ring clustering routing (E2HRC-RPL), which reduces the traffic load and decreases the packet loss ratio. Thus, the CT-RPL enhances the lifetime of the network by 30–40% and the packet delivery ratio by 5–10%.","clustering methods, energy consumption, energy efficiency, game theory,Internet of Things, routing protocol",,,SRS-JPUB-036,2020-10-16

Since its inception, SDN is a subject of a wide range of criticism mainly related to the scalability issues of the control plane. To address these limitations, recent architectures have supported the implementation of multiple controllers. Usage of multiple controllers leads to Controller Placement Problems (CPP) particularly in wide area networks. In most of the placement strategies, authors focused on propagation latency, because it is a critical factor in real networks. In this paper, the placement problem has been formulated on the basis of propagation latency as an optimisation problem, and Simulated Annealing (SA) technique has been used to analyse the problem. Further, we investigate the behaviour of SA with four different neighbouring solutions technique. The effectiveness of the algorithms is carried out on TataNld topology and implemented using MATLAB simulator.","software defined networks, scalability, controller placement problem,simulated annealing, wide area network, controller, switches,propagation delay, topology zoo, greedy, inversion,translation",,,SRS-JPUB-033,2020-09-01

The vulnerability of attacks is on a hike that manual or simple rule-based detection of cyber-attacks is not robust. In order to tackle cyber attacks in a reliable manner, an automated Intrusion Detection system equipped with a swarm intelligence (SI) based machine learning model (ML) is essential to deploy at entry points of the network. Nowadays, the application of SI with ML is used in various research areas. For an efficient IDS, choosing relevant features from the noisy data is an open question. In this regard, this paper proposes a method that utilizes the Whale Pearson hybrid feature selection wrapper for reducing the irrelevancy in the IDS model. Whale Pearson hybrid wrapper is an improved version of the binary Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA). The WOA is a type of SI algorithm which is inspired by the behavior of humpback whales. The proposed method has chosen 8 out of 42 features from the Hackereath Network attack prediction data-set, which are sufficient for building an efficient Intrusion detection model. The model trained with the eight features produces an accuracy of 80%, which is 8% greater than the accuracy produced by the original data-set with the KNN algorithm on ten-fold cross-validation","Intrusion Detection,

The solar panels can harvest a maximum amount of energy only if the rays are exactly perpendicular to the surface of the panels. Thus, the panels also should rotate from east to west in such a way that the rays are always perpendicular to the surface of the panels.

The disease that persists over a long period of time is known as chronic disease. Chronic diseases may create additional activity restrictions. Common chronic conditions include lung disease, heart stroke, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Chronic diseases usually show no symptoms and hence not diagnosed in advance. Hence, it is necessary to predict the patient-specific chronic diseases in early stage for effective prevention. Machine learning being the vital component of data analytics that facilitates the medical domain for malignancy predictions. Patients suffering from misdiagnosed and undiagnosed chronic diseases can be easily recognized with the help of these hospital systems. These systems enable the doctors to take precautionary measures and thereby minimizing the chances of a patient being affected. A new hybrid K-MLR framework using K-means and multiple linear regression has been proposed for diagnosing the type of lung cancer among the patients. As most of the real datasets are high-dimensional, this hybrid framework uses K-means clustering algorithm that eliminates the noise from the image-based dataset at the initial stage. Afterward to reduce the dimensionality, it detects the features of nodules in 3D lung CT scans and partitions the data to form the clusters. Finally, it reads the new patient data with malignant nodules to predict the type of associated cancer based on the intensity of the nodule features extracted from each CT scan report using multiple linear regression analysis.

Energy conservation in WSN is one of the most challenging tasks since the devices are connected to limited resource devices. So, clustering is the best choice to save energy in WSN. The sensor nodes are connected to the animal and move from one location to another because of the dynamic nature. In recent years, several clustering protocols have been proposed using an optimization algorithm to conserve energy in the network. However, it takes more time to converge in selecting the best cluster head in the network. The energy is therefore drained early in the network. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a Seagull Optimization Algorithm based Energy Aware Cluster Routing Protocol (SOA-EACR) in WSN to prolong the network's lifespan and reduce the end to end delay. The SOA-EACR balances the exploration and exploitation during the CH selection. Thus, it prolongs the lifespan of the network. The simulation is performed using MATLAB 2019a. The efficacy of SOA-EACR is compared with CLPSO, CACONET and GWO. The proposed SOA-EACR enhances the network life by 20 % and increases the packet delivery ratio by 2–5 %.","wireless sensor networks (wsns), livestock industry, health conditions, energy conservation, clustering, sensor nodes, dynamic nature, clustering protocols, optimization algorithm, cluster head, seagull optimization algorithm, energy aware cluster routing protocol (soa-eacr), end to end delay, matlab 2019a, packet delivery ratio",,,,2022-01-01

IoT can integrate any real-time entity with another, using sensing, computing and communication capabilities to offer enhanced services in everyday life. In this article, IoT-based patient health monitoring is considered for use in IoT sensors deployed in devices. These devices are attached to the body of the patient for timely tracking of his or her health condition. During data transfers from devices connected to the patient’s body to the doctor, the data may be susceptible to security threats. IoT devices are subjected to many routing attacks, like blackhole, greyhole, Sybil, sinkhole and wormhole attacks. Sybil attacks are the most dangerous routing attacks. This type of attack involves stealing the identities of legitimate nodes; this, in turn, leads to information loss, misinterpretation in the network and an increase in routing disturbances. Hence, in this paper, we propose the use of the traditional Caesar Cipher Algorithm (CCA) along with the lightweight encryption algorithm (LEA) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to detect and prevent Sybil attacks in an IoT environment. The proposed algorithm detects the false node in a particular path by announcing the attack to another node. It also prevents the attack by choosing an alternative path by which to forward data packets to the desired users.

PQ issues are raised not only in normal three-phase systems but also with the incorporation of different distributed generations (DGs), including renewable energy sources, storage systems, and other systems like diesel generators, fuel cells, etc. The prevalence of these issues comes from the non-linear features and rapid changing of power electronics devices, such as switch-mode converters for adjustable speed drives and diode or thyristor rectifiers. The wide use of these fast switching devices in the utility system leads to an increase in disturbances associated with harmonics and reactive power. The occurrence of PQ disturbances in turn creates several unwanted effects on the utility system. Therefore, many researchers are working on the enhancement of PQ using different custom power devices (CPDs). In this work, the authors highlight the significance of the PQ in the utility network, its effect, and its solution, using different CPDs, such as passive, active, and hybrid filters. Further, the authors point out several compensation strategies, including reference signal generation and gating signal strategies. In addition, this paper also presents the role of the active power filter (APF) in different DG systems. Some technical and economic considerations and future developments are also discussed in this literature. For easy reference, a volume of journals of more than 140 publications on this particular subject is reported.

The network topology in IoV paradigm is highly dynamic. Clustering is one of the promising solutions to maintain the route stability in the dynamic network. However, existing algorithms consume a considerable amount of time in the cluster head (CH) selection process. Thus, this study proposes a mobility aware dynamic clustering-based routing (MADCR) protocol in IoV to maximize the lifespan of networks and reduce the end-to-end delay of vehicles. The MADCR protocol consists of cluster formation and CH selection processes. A cluster is formed on the basis of Euclidean distance. The CH is then chosen using the mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA). The CH subsequently receives vehicle data and forwards such data to the Road Side Unit (RSU). The performance of the MADCR protocol is compared with that of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO), and Clustering Algorithm for Internet of Vehicles based on Dragonfly Optimizer (CAVDO).

In IoT, the network plays a crucial role in collecting data from sensors and moving to the sink. Increasing the network lifetime is a challenging task in IoT, which is connected to devices that are limited by resource. Clustering is one of the effective methods of increasing the network lifetime. However, improper cluster head (CH) selection easily drains the energy early in network nodes. With the aim to overcome the issue, this paper proposes the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic-based Particle Swarm Optimization (T2FL-PSO) algorithm to select the optimal CH to extend the network lifetime. The T2FL is highly useful in providing the accurate solution in uncertain network environments. Hence, T2FL is applied on the network parameters, residual energy, and the distance between sensor node and base station to determine the fitness value. Later, virtual clusters are formed on the basis of distance between sensor node and CH and between node and base station. To validate the performance of the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm, extensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB 2019a. Furthermore, the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization Clustering (PSO-C) and Particle Swarm Optimization Wang Zhang (PSO-WZ). The result confirms that the proposed T2FL-PSO increases the network lifetime by 10%–15% and the packet transmission ratio by 10%.

Trusting a third party has its own ramifications and results in a centralized architecture; therefore, this article addresses these issues by designing a Blockchain-based distributed IoT architecture that uses hash chains for secure key management. The proposed architecture exploits the key characteristics of the Blockchain technology, such as openness, immutability, traceability, and fault tolerance, to ensure data privacy in IoT scenarios and, thus, provides a secure environment for communication. This article also proposes a scheme for secure and efficient key generation and management for mutual authentication between communication entities.

In particular, the convolution neural networks are revived and shown their performance in multiple fields such as natural language understanding, signal processing, and computer vision. The property of translational invariance for convolutions has made a huge advantage in the field of computer vision to extract feature invariances appropriately. When these convolu-tions trained using back-propagation tend to prove their results ability to outperform existing machine vision techniques by overcoming the various hand-engineered machine vision models. Hence, a clear understanding of current deep learning methods is crucial. These convolution neural networks have proven to show their performance by attaining state-of-the-art performance in computer vision over years when applied on humongous data. Hence in this survey, we detail a set of state-of-the-art models in image classification evolved from the birth of convolutions to present ongoing research. Each state-of-the-art model evolved in the successive year is illustrated with architecture schema, implementation details, parametric tuning and their performance. It is observed that the neural architecture construction i.e. a supervised approach for an image classification problem is evolved as data construction with cautious augmentations i.e., a self-supervised approach. A detailed evolution from neural architecture construction to augmentation construction is il-lustrated by provided appropriate suggestions to improve the performance. Additionally, the implementation details and the appropriate source for the execution and reproducibility of results are tabulated","Image classification,deep learning, computer vision survey,convolution neural networks,IMAGENET dataset

There exists multiple kinds of works under attention mechanism which includes under image classification, fine-grained visual recognition, image captioning, video captioning, object detection and recognition tasks. Global and local attention are the two attention based mechanisms which helps in interpreting the attentive partial. Considering this criteria, there exists channel and spatial attention where in channel attention considers the most attentive channel among the produced block of channels and spatial attention considers which region among the space needs to be focused on. We have proposed a streamlined attention block module which helps in enhancing the feature based learning with less number of additional layers i.e., a GAP layer followed by a linear layer with an incorporation of second order pooling(GSoP) after every layer in the utilized encoder. This mechanism has produced better range dependencies by the conducted experimentation. We have experimented our model on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FGVC-Aircrafts datasets considering finegrained visual recognition.

Its main deployment is in the transmitter and receiver of the antenna. While transmission, the transmitter of radio at the extremities of the antenna furnishes the electricity which oscillates at the frequency of radio wave and energy is released as current as em waves. Some of the voltage is formed from the em wave that is invaded at the point of receiving to amplify the receiver. This study focuses on the analysis of the satellite system to aid in mobile antenna tracking. It also examines the techniques for fuzzy control which make up traditional networks that are used. Initially, a basic idea of tracking loops with stabilized antennas was suggested in light of the requirement for the margin of phase and bandwidth. If the gain of the track is reduced due to changes in attributes and throughput, it will be reduced. In addition, fuzzy regulators and PID constituents are used to enhance the loop. The results indicate that the higher and lower antenna tracking gains within the loop were the best fit and the loop's fluctuations are reduced. A controller based on fuzzy logic can be most efficient due to its simplicity and robustness. It is also discovered that fuzzy logic controllers are evaluated by their behavior in relation. This paper presents an evaluation of the controllers in fuzzy logic, which is based on its integration with conventional controllers. There are three gains in PID's regulator PID and every gain can be used to control the variables of inputs and outcomes. The effects of the responses were analyzed and were compared. The commonality was discovered in the results according to the increase in time for II/6 and II/3 based on PID's regulator PID stability, it can be improved by this system, and there is a reduction in the duration of stability. Furthermore, the period of stability may be reduced through the fusion of PID and fuzzy. The effectiveness of the system could be enhanced by the implementation of the neural network. It is also possible to design the two types of control that could be used to control the proposed solid platform","antenna, radio, transmitter, receiver, waves, electricity, satellite, mobile, tracking, fuzzy control, pid, regulator, loop, stability, neural network",,,,2022-03-07

So, the consideration of security levels in task scheduling is remains to be more critical for secured processing. This works intends to afford the optimization strategies for optimal task scheduling with multi-objective constraints in cloud environment. Accordingly, the proposed optimal task allocation framework considers the objectives such as execution time, risk probability, and task priority.

Today many automated companies are designing vehicles, but we are still unable to get automatic parking system in an area. Finding free parking slot/space has a probability of revealing user's privacy (i.e., either by service provider to third party/attacker or submitted information [user personal information] can be hacked by an attacker [via performing attacks like Man in Middle, Denial of Service, etc.]). Hence, privacy is a main issue in parking. Providing sufficient privacy in parking to vehicle users is a primary concern of this chapter. For that, this chapter used the blockchain technology to avoid privacy issues (raised in parking searching). Blockchain technology makes reservation of parking slot transparent, decentralized, and secure (privacy-preserved)","technology, smart devices, parking, automated companies, vehicles, automatic parking system, privacy, user personal information, service provider, attacker, man in middle, denial of service, blockchain technology, reservation, decentralized",,,,2021-04-01

The discovery of appropriate patterns and trends to analyse the text documents from this large big data (i.e., large volume of data) is a big issue. Text mining is a process of extracting interesting and non- trivial patterns from huge amount of text documents. There exist different techniques and tools to mine the text (also other data format) and discover valuable information for future prediction and decision making process. Basically, there are two terms used in making or extracting some relevant information from a data-set, i.e., prediction modelling, and text mining. Predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place/to detect an email, how likely that it is spam. Similarly, text mining used in applications like digital libraries, academic research field, life science, social media, business intelligence, etc. Today’s different text mining techniques are available for analysing the text patterns and their mining process, some of them are included here as: document classification (text classification, document standardization), information retrieval (keyword search/querying and indexing), document clustering (phrase clustering), natural language processing (spelling correction, lemmatization, grammatical parsing, and word sense disambiguation), information extraction (relationship extraction/link analysis), and web mining (web link analysis), etc.

and changing its constructive parameters is an urgent issue, since it allows to develop new efficient tillage working parts

accumulation of kinetic energy and changes in the constructive parameters of dynamic tillage working parts. The object of
research is a dynamic arrow-shaped tillage working part with a capture width of 330 mm for surface tillage to a depth of 14
cm. The subject of research is the regularities of the process of accumulating kinetic energy in elastic elements and changes
in the constructive parameters of a dynamic tillage working part. The research was carried out using methods of
mathematical modeling based on the study of physical laws that occur during soil cultivation; experimental research on
energy assessment of tillage working parts, analysis and generalization of experimental data. The scientific novelty of the
paper is represented by mathematical models of the process of accumulating kinetic energy and changing constructive
parameters of a dynamic tillage working part. Mathematical models and graphic interpretation of the dependences of the
axial force on the elastic element, the traction resistance of the dynamic working part, the average value of the width of
capture on the speed of movement of the dynamic working part are presented in this paper. In particular, it was found that
under the specific conditions of experiments with an increase in the speed of operation from 1.94 to 3.61 m / s, the average
value of the width of capture of a dynamic tillage working part decreases from 306.90 to 300.50 mm. At rest, the dynamic
soil tillage implement has a working width of 330 mm. The meaning of the swath width of a dynamic tillage working body,
depending on the characteristics of the soil and the speed of movement, fluctuates within certain limits set by design
parameters and is a random value. The statistical standard error of the sample mean value of the traction resistance and the
speed of movement of the dynamic working body, respectively, varied in the range of 0.094 - 0.0167 kN and 0.012 - 0.032

Energy conservation in WSN is one of the most challenging tasks since the devices are connected to limited resource devices. So, clustering is the best choice to save energy in WSN. The sensor nodes are connected to the animal and move from one location to another because of the dynamic nature. In recent years, several clustering protocols have been proposed using an optimization algorithm to conserve energy in the network. However, it takes more time to converge in selecting the best cluster head in the network. The energy is therefore drained early in the network. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a Seagull Optimization Algorithm based Energy Aware Cluster Routing Protocol (SOA-EACR) in WSN to prolong the network's lifespan and reduce the end to end delay. The SOA-EACR balances the exploration and exploitation during the CH selection. Thus, it prolongs the lifespan of the network. The simulation is performed using MATLAB 2019a. The efficacy of SOA-EACR is compared with CLPSO, CACONET and GWO. The proposed SOA-EACR enhances the network life by 20 % and increases the packet delivery ratio by 2–5 %","wireless sensor networks, livestock industry, health conditions, energy conservation, clustering, sensor nodes, dynamic nature, clustering protocols, optimization algorithm, seagull optimization algorithm, energy aware cluster routing protocol, end to end delay, matlab 2019a, packet delivery ratio, network lifespan",,,,2022-01-01

The problem of the network anomaly detection is to determine, if the network incoming traffic is legitimate (or) anomalous. Automated detection systems designed to identify incoming anomalous traffic patterns usually apply widely used machine learning techniques. However, irrespective of any system model which is developed to identify anomalous traffic, all these models requires comparing anomalous and normal traffic patterns. Such comparisons implicitly depend on the ability of the underlying machine learning model to gauge the similarity between a known legitimate observation and the target. The efficiency of any network anomalous detection system depends on the use of distance (or) similarity measures and how they are actually applied. A novel distance function which can be applied to determine the similarity between two conditional feature pattern vectors is an important contribution of present research. Feature dimensionality is another important issue for any machine learning algorithm. In the present work, feature reduction is achieved using the proposed feature transformation technique. However, our approach for feature transformation uses the proposed gaussian distance function to achieve dimensionality reduction to represent the original input dataset in the new transformation space. We have also proposed new computation expressions for determining equivalent deviation and threshold in gaussian space. Experiments are performed on KDD and NSL-KDD datasets by considering widely applied classifier algorithms in various state-of-art research contributions. For performance validation of machine learning models, k-fold cross validation is applied by setting k to 10 through considering evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision and recall. Experiment results have proved that our approach for anomaly detection that applies the proposed feature transformation technique proved comparatively better to detection methods CANN, GARUDA, and UTTAMA addressed in the recent research literature","Similarity function,

Typically agriculturalists or specialists perceive the plants with a naked eye for detection and identification of an illness. Machine vision models, in specific Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have directed an impact in feature extraction to a greater extent. Since 2015, numerous solicitations for the automatic classification and recognition of crop illnesses have been established.

Methods: In this paper, we proposed, analyzed, and assessed various state-of-the-art models proposed over a decade. These models are pre-trained with the finest parameters where we modeled a design-oriented method with numerous leaf-images and classified them into infection and healthy class for each type of leaf independently.
Results: Through our examination, we concluded that VGG models stand-alone with many cited prototypes and give on par results. As declared, these VGG models (VGG16 and VGG19) are utilized for feature extraction, and further, we augmented a set of dense layers and train them consequently for classification. The performances of various machine vision prototypes were pictorially perceived and their sophisticated architecture is not only capable of extracting detailed features but also repressed many loop-holes. The performance is assessed and computed for several types of leaf images and the accuracy scores attained were more than 97.5% for VGG16 and 96.72% for VGG19.
Conclusion: AUC-ROC curves were portrayed to illustrate its inspiration in defining an accurate classification where VGG16 and VGG19 have at least 96.6% and 95% area under the curve (AUC) which resembles their robustness."," Leaf classification, deep learning, transfer learning, automated plant diagnosis, CNNs",,,,2020-08-01

The manual detection and identification of the plant diseases require a careful and observative examination through expertise. To overcome manual testing procedures an automated identification and detection can be implied which provides faster, scalable and precisive solutions. In this research, the contributions of our work are threefold. Firstly, a bi-linear convolution neural network (Bi-CNNs) for plant leaf disease identification and classification is proposed. Secondly, we fine-tune VGG and pruned ResNets and utilize them as feature extractors and connect them to fully connected dense networks. The hyperparameters are tuned to reach faster convergence and obtain better generalization during stochastic optimization of Bi-CNN(s). Finally, the proposed model is designed to leverage scalability by implying the Bi-CNN model into a real-world application and release it as an open-source. The model is designed on variant testing criteria ranging from 10% to 50%. These models are evaluated on gold-standard classification measures. To study the performance, testing samples were expanded by 5x (i.e., from 10% to 50%) and it is found that the deviation in the accuracy was quite low (0.27%) which resembles the consistent generalization ability. Finally, the larger model obtained an accuracy score of 94.98% for 38 distinct classes","Bilinear convolution neural networks (Bi-CNN’s), plant disease classification,mobile API, deep learning, neural networks",,,,2021-09-03

Energy conservation in WSN is one of the most challenging tasks since the devices are connected to limited resource devices. So, clustering is the best choice to save energy in WSN. The sensor nodes are connected to the animal and move from one location to another because of the dynamic nature. In recent years, several clustering protocols have been proposed using an optimization algorithm to conserve energy in the network. However, it takes more time to converge in selecting the best cluster head in the network. The energy is therefore drained early in the network. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a Seagull Optimization Algorithm based Energy Aware Cluster Routing Protocol (SOA-EACR) in WSN to prolong the network's lifespan and reduce the end to end delay. The SOA-EACR balances the exploration and exploitation during the CH selection. Thus, it prolongs the lifespan of the network. The simulation is performed using MATLAB 2019a. The efficacy of SOA-EACR is compared with CLPSO, CACONET and GWO.

guides in every state. The rising number of accidents
involving motorcycles is an alarming issue. The
objective of the system is to reduce the biker
accidents by turning off the engine when there is no
helmet to prevent accidents and make bikers journey
safe. To make drivers ride safe we are adding few
features to the helmet-like alcohol sensor which
detects the person's alcohol percentage and prevents
the bike from starting, vibration sensor to detect
whether the biker wore his/her helmet. Most people
tend to neglect the importance of the helmet and

The activation functions employed in deep neural networks have a huge impact on the training model and the reliability of the model. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) has recently emerged as the most popular and extensively utilized activation function. ReLU has some flaws, such as the fact that it is only active when the units are positive during back-propagation and zero otherwise. This causes neurons to die (dying ReLU) and a shift in bias. However, unlike ReLU activation functions, Swish activation functions do not remain stable or move in a single direction. This research proposes a new activation function named NIPUNA for deep neural networks. We test this activation by training on customized convolutional neural networks (CCNN). On benchmark datasets (Fashion MNIST images of clothes, MNIST dataset of handwritten digits), the contributions are examined and compared to various activation functions.

Generally, the data are outsourced to cloud storage servers in encrypted form. Access control methods can be used on encrypted outsourced data to facilitate and regulate access. Multi-authority attribute-based encryption is a propitious technique to control who can access encrypted data in inter-domain applications such as sharing data between organizations, sharing data in healthcare, etc. The data owner may require the flexibility to share the data with known and unknown users. The known or closed-domain users may be internal employees of the organization, and unknown or open-domain users may be outside agencies, third-party users, etc. In the case of closed-domain users, the data owner becomes the key issuing authority, and in the case of open-domain users, various established attribute authorities perform the task of key issuance. Privacy preservation is also a crucial requirement in cloud-based data-sharing systems. This work proposes the SP-MAACS scheme, a secure and privacy-preserving multi-authority access control system for cloud-based healthcare data sharing. Both open and closed domain users are considered, and policy privacy is ensured by only disclosing the names of policy attributes. The values of the attributes are kept hidden. Characteristic comparison with similar existing schemes shows that our scheme simultaneously provides features such as multi-authority setting, expressive and flexible access policy structure, privacy preservation, and scalability. The performance analysis carried out by us shows that the decryption cost is reasonable enough. Furthermore, the scheme is demonstrated to be adaptively secure under the standard model.","electronic health records, access control, cloud storage, attribute-based encryption,multiple authorities, privacy preservation",,Active,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/5/2617,2023-02-27

Such a unsupervised method can be used during imputation for identifying the optimal clusters. Optimal clusters reduce the search space during imputation and thus achieve dimensionality reduction. The proposed method uses MKNNMBI imputation method in which the non-missing dataset used for imputing the missing values is reduced. The reduction is achieved by using spectral partitioning method for which the non-missing dataset is represented as a graph. The spectrum of a Laplacian graph is obtained using spectral clustering from which the optimal l eigen values are identified as optimal cluster centers for imputation.

Here, the load balancing strategy estimates the underloaded and overloaded system and balances the nodes as required. Thus, a load balancing strategy has been performed to equally load all connected Virtual machines (VM) in the cloud environment. However, conventional Load balancing methods in cloud computing confront non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness optimization issues. Therefore, this article has proposed a novel Load balancing methodology between VMs using the Hybrid Krill herd and Whale-based Deep Belief Neural model (HKHW-DBNM). This proposed method aims to improve the system's performance by balancing the Load between the VMs, optimizing the makespan, improving resource usage, reducing the degree of imbalance, and so on. Here, the developed load balancing algorithm distributes workload across multiple resources by reducing the demand on each resource and improving overall system performance. Furthermore, it helps to guarantee that resources are utilized efficiently, reducing execution time and optimizing costs. The implementation of this process has been carried out in the Python platform. The robustness of the proposed system is verified via the comparison with existing Load balancing approaches. The comparison results show that the proposed load-balancing method performs better than existing methods.","Cloud computing,

Consequently, different operating systems and virtual machines have validated the user’s requirements and necessitated effective scheduling techniques in the cloud environment. Moreover, resource allocation and job scheduling are significant features in cloud computing. Nevertheless, the main drawback of the cloud computing model is the higher computation time that causes the deadline of all work. Previously, several approaches were proposed to diminish the computation time, but those techniques only apply to a few tasks. Therefore the novel Whale-based Convolution Neural Framework (WbCNF) strategy can effectively improve the task allocation system and reduce the job execution time. Moreover, the developed approach is implemented in the Python framework, and results show that the computation time has reduced the quantity of the tasks taken for the experimentation. Consequently, to verify the proposed technique’s efficiency, the proposed method is compared with conventional techniques in terms of performance metrices; the outcomes prove the enhancement of the cloud computing system.","Cloud computing,

However, unwanted delays hinder the detection rate. A malicious user might utilize vast quantities of computational power. The cloud provides to perform attacks both within and without the cloud. Furthermore, there are major challenges for intrusion detection due to the ease of the cloud and also the continual restructuring and movement of cloud resources. Intruder detection, feature extraction, and data processing are all included in the novel optimization-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) paradigm that will be presented in this study. Data normalization is used to first pre-process the input data. Then, appropriate feature extraction is carried out, including the extraction of (a) raw features, (b) statistical features, then (c) higher-order statistical features using suggested kurtosis. The detection phase is then applied to the retrieved features. A two-stage ensemble method is suggested for finding intruders in clouds. Random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), optimal Neural Network (NN), and RNN make up the suggested ensemble technique. The RF, SVM, and Optimized NN algorithms are directly fed the collected features. The output of these classifiers is then provided to the RNN classifier (i.e.), RF output to RNN1, SVM output to RNN2, and optimized NN output to RNN3. Then, the weighted average of RNN 1, 2, and 3 is considered as the final output. A Self Adaptive Salp Swarm Optimization optimizes the weights of NN for exact detection (SA-SSO). Finally, a test is conducted to confirm the developed model’s superiority.",Machine Learning,Machine Learning,Active,https://content.iospress.com/articles/web-intelligence/web221800,2023-04-05

Young people who are technologically savvy have witnessed a significant scientific increase in the latter two areas. Despite this, farming is still regarded as a labor-intensive endeavour. Most farmers are uneducated and lack a scientific understanding of farming practices. Crop cultivation anywhere in the world is dependent on the climate, also known as seasons, and soil properties; however, increasing crop production is dependent on a variety of factors, most notably temperature. This work proposes a crop recommendation system to address the issue of increasing crop production. A vision of the perfect harvest before planting would be extremely beneficial to farmers and other stakeholders in making appropriate decisions about improving yields for local use, and it may inspire increased capacity and a wider range of product options for businesses. Precision agriculture is a modern farming strategy that advises farmers on the sorts of crops they should plant based on data collected through studies on soil features, soil types, and crop yields. This style of agriculture is also known as ""high-intensity agriculture"". Our system employed Machine Learning procedures to recommend the appropriate crops. This system then reduces the financial losses experienced by farmers because of establishing the ominous harvests. This problem is addressed in this paper by proposing a recommendation system using an ensemble model with majority voting and an accuracy of 99.4 percent.","Crop recommendation,Machine learning,Ensemble model,Voting classifier,Recommendation system",Machine learning,active,,2023-07-06
