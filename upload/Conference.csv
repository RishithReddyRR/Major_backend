AI-assisted techniques such as linear programming, genetic algorithms, and neural networks can be used to optimize the allocation of resources such as personnel and equipment to tasks and activities within a project. This can lead to improved use of resources, reduced costs, and improved project scheduling and completion times. Additionally, AI can be used in real-time, providing project managers with the ability to make quick, informed decisions about resource allocation as the project progresses. Predictive analysis can also be done to anticipate future resource needs and make adjustments accordingly. Overall, the use of AI in project management can lead to better project outcomes and increased satisfaction for stakeholders.","job shop scheduling,buildings,project management,real time systems,team work,resource management,stake holders",machine learning,active,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=Ur_25LkAAAAJ
