Data Imputation is normally done to fill one or more missing data attribute values. Imputation helps to perform supervised or un-supervised learning after the dataset is free from missing data. Learning process helps the discovery of hidden, valuable and important information that can provide insightful results. Imputation is a data pre-processing task that requires applying distance function to find missing values. In this paper, a distance function named MANTRA is proposed to impute missing data values. The distance function is also called as the imputation measure since it is designed for imputation of missing values. A working example is demonstrated that shows how imputation is achieved using proposed distance function, MANTRA. It is proved that the nominal value that is filled after imputation is same as the original.","medical record instances, data imputation, learning process, distance function, missing values.",,,,2018-10-01,,,

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure. Improved accuracies of classifiers on U2R and R2L attacks have been recorded in the experimental results obtained for experiments conducted."," internet of things, data mining, security, intrusion detection, computational complexity.",,,,2017-09-01,,,

Experimental results show that accuracies obtained using our approach is better compared to other approaches. In particular U2R and R2L accuracies are recorded to be very much promising. This research shows an approach which addresses the improvement in overall accuracy and also improvement in detecting R2L and U2R attack accuracies.

SDN enables the software to manage the networks dynamically. Using the software, abstracting of a physical network with virtual networks is possible using SDN. SDN and network functions virtualization (NFV) is that the two of them use network abstraction. SDN tries to separate network control functions from network forwarding functions, while NFV tries to abstract network forwarding and other networking functions from the equipment on which it runs. In this manner, both depend vigorously on virtualization to enable network design and infrastructure to be abstracted in software and then implemented by underlying software across hardware platforms and devices. While both of these new technologies are different in design and implementations, both can enhance network performance effectively. There are various reasons for the growth of both technologies. They can drive big data, smart devices, and distributed servers in an extensive manner.

Time profiled association mining has two main challenges that must be addressed. These include addressing i) dissimilarity measure that also holds monotonicity property and can efficiently prune itemset associations ii) approaches for estimating prevalence values of itemset associations over time. The pioneering research that addressed time profiled association mining is by J.S. Yoo using Euclidean distance. It is widely known fact that this distance measure suffers from high dimensionality. Given a time stamped transaction database, time profiled association mining refers to the discovery of underlying and hidden time profiled itemset associations whose true prevalence variations are similar as the user query sequence under subset constraints that include i) allowable dissimilarity value ii) a reference query time sequence iii) dissimilarity function that can find degree of similarity between a temporal itemset and reference. In this paper, we propose a novel dissimilarity measure whose design is a function of product based gaussian membership function through extending the similarity function proposed in our earlier research (G-Spamine). Our approach, MASTER (Mining of Similar Temporal Associations) which is primarily inspired from SPAMINE uses the dissimilarity measure proposed in this paper and support bound estimation approach proposed in our earlier research. Expression for computation of distance bounds of temporal patterns are designed considering the proposed measure and support estimation approach. Experiments are performed by considering naïve, sequential, Spamine and G-Spamine approaches under various test case considerations that study the scalability and computational performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results prove the scalability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be performed in either snapshot or lattice-based approach. Sequential and SPAMINE methods for similarity-profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar are based on the snapshot database scan and lattice scan, respectively. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database time slot by time slot. The major limitation of Sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the disk for finding itemset support computations. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in the memory and also eliminates the need to retain database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a compressed time-stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference w.r.t each time slot and validating whether the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed Sequential approach is from the fact that it is a single database scan approach excluding the initial database scan performed for computing true supports of singleton items. VRKSHA overcomes the major limitation of retaining database in memory that is required by SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, MASTER algorithms. Experiment results prove that computational time and memory consumed by VRKSHA are significantly very much better than by approaches such as Naïve, Sequential, SPAMINE, and G-SPAMINE. To the best of our survey and knowledge, VRKSHA is the pioneering work to introduce and propose a compressed tree-based data structure for mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns in the area of time-profiled temporal association mining.","mining, association patterns, temporal database, time slots, itemsets, database scan, vrksha, similarity-profiled, compressed tree-based data structure, temporal association mining",,,VRK-C090,2020-11-01,,,

Datasets generated in an IoT environment usually have missing values. The presence of missing values makes the classifier unsuitable for classification task. This article introduces (a) a novel imputation technique for imputation of missing data values (b) a classifier which is based on feature transformation to perform classification (c) imputation measure for similarity computation between any two instances that can also be used as similarity measure.

It is proved that the performance of proposed approach is better when compared to existing classifiers when the imputation process is performed using F-Kmeans and K-Means imputation techniques. It is also observed that accuracies for attack classes scan, malicious operation, denial of service, spying, data type probing, wrong setup are 100% while it is 99% for malicious control attack class when the proposed imputation and classification technique are applied.","anomaly detection, attack detection, iot environment, missing values, imputation technique, classifier, feature transformation, similarity measure, kmeans, f-kmeans",,,VRK-J089,2020-05-13,,,

Designing an efficient intrusion detection system has three primary challenges that include addressing high dimensionality problem, choice of learning algorithm, and distance or similarity measure used to find the similarity value between any two traffic patterns or input observations. Feature representation and dimensionality reduction have been studied and addressed widely in the literature and have also been applied for the design of intrusion detection systems (IDS). The choice of classifiers is also studied and applied widely in the design of IDS. However, at the heart of IDS lies the choice of distance measure that is required for an IDS to judge an incoming observation as normal or abnormal. This challenge has been understudied and relatively less addressed in the research literature both from academia and from industry. This research aims at introducing a novel distance measure that can be used to perform feature clustering and feature representation for efficient intrusion detection. Recent studies such as CANN proposed feature reduction techniques for improving detection and accuracy rates of IDS that used Euclidean distance. However, accuracies of attack classes such as U2R and R2L are not significantly promising. Our approach GARUDA is based on clustering feature patterns incrementally and then representing features in different transformation space through using a novel fuzzy Gaussian dissimilarity measure. Experiments are conducted on both KDD and NSL-KDD datasets. The accuracy and detection rates of proposed approach are compared for classifiers such as kNN, J48, naïve Bayes, along with CANN and CLAPP approaches. Experiment results proved that proposed approach resulted in the improved accuracy and detection rates for U2R and R2L attack classes when compared to other approaches.","anomaly detection system, malicious traffic patterns, intrusion detection system, dimensionality reduction, learning algorithm, distance measure, feature representation, clustering feature patterns, fuzzy gaussian dissimilarity measure, detection rates",,,VRK-J088,2020-01-01,,,

The problem of the network anomaly detection is to determine, if the network incoming traffic is legitimate (or) anomalous. Automated detection systems designed to identify incoming anomalous traffic patterns usually apply widely used machine learning techniques. However, irrespective of any system model which is developed to identify anomalous traffic, all these models requires comparing anomalous and normal traffic patterns. Such comparisons implicitly depend on the ability of the underlying machine learning model to gauge the similarity between a known legitimate observation and the target. The efficiency of any network anomalous detection system depends on the use of distance (or) similarity measures and how they are actually applied. A novel distance function which can be applied to determine the similarity between two conditional feature pattern vectors is an important contribution of present research. Feature dimensionality is another important issue for any machine learning algorithm. In the present work, feature reduction is achieved using the proposed feature transformation technique. However, our approach for feature transformation uses the proposed gaussian distance function to achieve dimensionality reduction to represent the original input dataset in the new transformation space. We have also proposed new computation expressions for determining equivalent deviation and threshold in gaussian space.

The proposed imputation function is extended by using our previous research in which a similarity measure for temporal pattern mining named as ASTRA is proposed. The measure ASTRA is modified suitably to serve as an imputation measure.","imputation, missing data, data mining, medical data, pre-processing, imputation measure, algorithm, temporal pattern mining, astra, similarity measure",,,VRK-C084,2019-09-19,,,

The construction of decision tree is based on the principle of distance computation instead of finding Gini index or Information Gain of split attributes. The distance function is the normalized Lp-norm distance function with p=2. The fundamental idea for obtaining decision tree is based on determining the class based probability vectors. The distance is computed for probability vectors computed for attributes and root node of the decision tree.

Time profiled association mining has two main challenges that must be addressed. These include addressing i) dissimilarity measure that also holds monotonicity property and can efficiently prune itemset associations ii) approaches for estimating prevalence values of itemset associations over time. The pioneering research that addressed time profiled association mining is by J.S. Yoo using Euclidean distance. It is widely known fact that this distance measure suffers from high dimensionality. Given a time stamped transaction database, time profiled association mining refers to the discovery of underlying and hidden time profiled itemset associations whose true prevalence variations are similar as the user query sequence under subset constraints that include i) allowable dissimilarity value ii) a reference query time sequence iii) dissimilarity function that can find degree of similarity between a temporal itemset and reference. In this paper, we propose a novel dissimilarity measure whose design is a function of product based gaussian membership function through extending the similarity function proposed in our earlier research (G-Spamine). Our approach, MASTER (Mining of Similar Temporal Associations) which is primarily inspired from SPAMINE uses the dissimilarity measure proposed in this paper and support bound estimation approach proposed in our earlier research. Expression for computation of distance bounds of temporal patterns are designed considering the proposed measure and support estimation approach. Experiments are performed by considering naïve, sequential, Spamine and G-Spamine approaches under various test case considerations that study the scalability and computational performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results prove the scalability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be either snapshot or lattice based. Sequential method for similarity profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar is based on the snapshot database scan. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database, time slot by time slot. The major limitation of sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the memory for finding itemset supports. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a time stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference and validating if the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed sequential approach is from the fact that it does not require database retention in memory. The case study demonstrating working example proves the significance and efficiency of the proposed approach.","Association pattern mining, time-stamped temporal database, snapshot database scan, sequential method, VRKSHA, multi-tree structure, temporal itemsets, dissimilarity threshold, pattern pruning, database retention, case study, efficiency, true supports.",,,,2018-06-19,,,

A time-stamped transaction (temporal) database may be viewed as a snapshot database defined over several time slots. The brute-force approach for finding support value for every possible itemset from the time-stamped temporal database requires 2n true support computations and repeated scan of the original database. This task increases the overall computational complexity. This problem was addressed in some of the past research studies such as SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, Z-SPAMINE by proposing support estimation and pruning approaches which substantially reduced the total number of true support computations. However, the limitation is that even these approaches required scanning the database repeatedly to know true supports of itemsets when itemset pruning condition fails. In this research, we propose a novel tree structure, called GANDIVA which facilitates to compute all itemset true supports by performing tree scan thus eliminating the database scan. The idea is to construct the tree called GANDIVA which helps to know supports of all time stamped temporal itemsets from the constructed tree. Another important advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require original database to be retained in the memory after time profiled pattern tree (GANDIVA) is constructed from the database. A case study showing the time profiled pattern tree generation process along with computation of true supports is demonstrated that shows the importance of proposed approach. The significant advantage of GANDIVA over SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, Z-SPAMINE, and MASTER is that GANDIVA requires zero database scans after the first scan is made. GANDIVA is the pioneering research to propose a novel tree-based framework for seasonal temporal data mining.","Support values, itemsets, snapshot databases, time-stamped temporal database, computational complexity, pruning, GANDIVA, tree structure, true supports, database scan, memory retention, case study, time profiled pattern tree, seasonal temporal data mining, zero database scans.",,,,2018-06-19,,,

This is because the support of patterns violates the monotonicity property in temporal databases. In our case, support is a vector of values and not a single value. In this paper, we present a novel approach to retrieve temporal association patterns whose prevalence values are similar to those of the user specified reference. This allows us to significantly reduce support computations by defining novel expressions to estimate support bounds. The proposed approach eliminates computational overhead in finding similar temporal patterns. We then introduce a novel dissimilarity measure, which is the fuzzy Gaussian-based dissimilarity measure. The measure also holds the monotonicity property. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms brute force and sequential approaches. We also compare the performance of the proposed approach with the SPAMINE which uses the Euclidean measure. The proposed approach uses monotonicity property to prune temporal patterns without computing unnecessary true supports and distances.","Temporal association pattern,Monotonicity,Outliers,Similar,Prevalence",,,,2016-11-18,,,

Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be either snapshot or lattice based. Sequential method for similarity profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar is based on the snapshot database scan. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database, time slot by time slot. The major limitation of sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the memory for finding itemset supports. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a time stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference and validating if the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed sequential approach is from the fact that it does not require database retention in memory. The case study demonstrating working example proves the significance and efficiency of the proposed approach.","Association pattern mining, time-stamped temporal database, sequential method, VRKSHA, multi-tree structure, temporal itemsets, dissimilarity threshold, pattern pruning, database retention, case study, efficiency.",,,,2018-06-19,,,

A new expression for standard deviation is derived for use in the expression for similarity measure.

The patterns which are of interest to user are to be discovered which requires scanning database repeatedly. The patterns which are not of interest to the user are called as outlier patterns. In this paper, we discover the temporal patterns which are of interest to the user by estimating support bound sequences of temporal patterns and then using these support sequences to estimate distance bounds with respect reference of interest. The distance measure chosen is Euclidean. Since Euclidean distance does not consist upper bound, we normalize the distance to make it feasible between bounds 0 and 1. The approach yields similar temporal patterns as that of conventional association patterns which requires multiple scans. In the best case, a single scan is sufficient however, in the worst; it is required to obtain true supports for some of the patterns.

Even though several works have been proposed in the field of moving object detection, many of them do not consider the problem of segmenting real objects from their shadows. The shadow is considered part of the object, thus leading to possibly large errors in the subsequent steps of object localisation and tracking. In this paper we propose a shadow detection algorithm able to remove shadows from the blobs of moving objects, using division images and Expectation-Maximization histogram analysis. Experimental results prove that the use of the proposed method can significantly increase the performance of a video analysis system.","Video Surveillance,Intelligent Transportation System,Video Surveillance System,Video Annotation,Shadow Detection",,,,2009-01-01,,,

These CNN proved their versatility in various domains, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation (ROI). Variant neural architectures have been proposed over the past decade with increasing depth, width, and channels for precise feature extraction. In images, feature extraction is a crucial step. The CNN will be able to extract the spatial information, but they can't retrieve the spatial orientations of the entities residing in the image. Further, attention to the required features is not seen. These points are considered challenges, and a neural architecture is to be constructed by overhauling these loops. Hence, we propose an attention block which can be easily embedded into standard convolution neural networks and eventually outperforms the plain CNN on CIFAR-10 and the NIH Malaria Data Set.

To shorten the morbidity of malaria, accurate and fast diagnostic tools are to be implied with Artificial Intelligence. In this research, an automated, fast, and accurate diagnostic model for one-shot detection and classification of malaria thin blood smears were developed using the Deep Siamese Capsule Network (D-SCN) and contributions for our research are threefold. Firstly, we proposed the D-SCN model which consists of two crucial phases which are feature extraction and feature discrimination. Secondly, we implied an end-to-end trained capsule network with an imperative routing (IR) mechanism for the feature extraction phase to capture feature invariances. Finally, at the feature discrimination phase, Lorentz, L1 and L2 similarity metrics were proposed for the dissimilation of features. During experimentation, it is observed that the Lorentz similarity metric provided more discriminative capability by acquiring the least MSE at most of the instances. Further, an algorithm is proposed to obtain faster convergence by cautiously tuning the hyperparameters, and this aided in decreasing the noise scale in training the D-SCN. The experimental outcomes proved that D-SCN outperformed with the highest detection accuracy of 97.24% for Lorentz as a similarity measure, and the Capsule network with IR mechanism outperformed with the highest classification accuracy of 98.89%. To our knowledge, the proposed research implications are the first applications of D-SCN for one-shot detection and classification of thin blood smears with state-of-the-art performance.","Deep Siamese capsule network,Neural network,Machine learning,Malaria parasites detection,Deep learning",,,,2022-04-21,,,

PPG technique is highly induced by motion artifacts and its characteristics depend on the physiological condition of the person. While the collection of data, the PGG must be calibrated. In this research, a novel approach using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) based feature extraction technique with GRU network for the classification of hypertension is proposed. DT-CWT gives shift invariance compared to Continuous wavelet transforms and dual tree structure helps to extract the real and imaginary coefficients of the features. DT-CWT helps to integrate the signal patterns even disintegrating them during testing procedure. Further, these extracted features are fed into a variant neural architecture consisting of sequential GRU layers stacked over fully connected dense layers. It is observed, utilizing GRU layers led to extract precise features for sequential signal data by out-performing existing models.

Such a unsupervised method can be used during imputation for identifying the optimal clusters. Optimal clusters reduce the search space during imputation and thus achieve dimensionality reduction. The proposed method uses MKNNMBI imputation method in which the non-missing dataset used for imputing the missing values is reduced. The reduction is achieved by using spectral partitioning method for which the non-missing dataset is represented as a graph. The spectrum of a Laplacian graph is obtained using spectral clustering from which the optimal l eigen values are identified as optimal cluster centers for imputation. The imputation is done using this reduced optimal non-missing dataset. The imputed dataset is evaluated by comparing the accuracies of classifiers like SVM, C4.5, NB and kNN.

Even though the methodologies used for such farming are very good at providing a good yield, such activities still require a lot of time and man work for efficient output. Such people are starting to rely on some automation and monitoring to as most of the people in such urban localities have very little time to spend on such activities, this has recently become a trend as the sensors used monitor these plants are relatively inexpensive and also usage of such sensors which provide the users with a lot more information which can be used to make dynamic decisions based on various conditions and requirements turns out to be even more efficient as it is not ideal to keep providing the same amount of nutrients and water irrespective of their need, therefore such constant monitoring helps out the users to monitor and decide on what actions to perform such as how much nutrients have to sprayed and how much water needs to be supplied. The only issue in implementing such system arises when we need to use a cloud service to manage all the data which is typically an expensive service and since it is not a one-time expense like the sensors, the users have to keep paying as a monthly/yearly basis for such services. The main aim of this study is to implement a simple and easy to use local server which the user can run on their personal computers or a cheap computation device such as a raspberry pi to avoid the heavy costs of cloud services.",": IoT , Cloud, Precision Agriculture, Automation.",,,,2021-01-01,,,

The lower the margin, the lower the tolerance for payment fraud. In observance, once fraud happens, the cardholder disputes the charge and also the debit is typically off, which suggests either the cardholders bank or the bourgeois absorbs the loss (see Aleskerov, E., Freisleben, B., Rao, B.: Cardwatch: a neural network- based database mining system for credit card fraud detection.

Cumulatively, fraud represents a big monetary risk to the bourgeois and also the provision bank. to scale back fraud, 3D secure, fraud detection techniques, chip and pin technologies are used. However, if 3D secure and chip and pin technology exist, why is fraud detection used? There are two main reasons. First, the full value of 3D secure and chip and pin technology is comparatively high compared to the value of fraud detection. e.g., whereas online merchants care concerning conversion, 3D secure reduces it by many percent (>5%). Hence, once they have the choice, several online merchants conceive to deactivate 3D secure and manage the chance of payment fraud themselves. Second, adding additional security layers to the shopping method greatly reduces checkout rate and, in turn, convenience for the client. Whereas convenience for consumers might appear as if a fuzzy conception initially, for corporations like Amazon, that pioneered one-click checkout, its a selling argument and a method to convert and grow revenues. The objectives of MasterCard fraud detection are to scale back losses because of fraud payments for each provision banks and merchants and revenue opportunities for merchants increases.","Spark,Cassandra,Big data",,,,2021-03-16,,,

Traditionally IDSs (Intrusion detection systems) have been developed by applying machine learning techniques and adopted single learning mechanism. This is later extended by developing Intrusion Detection Systems by adopting multiple learning mechanisms. Such systems have addressed better detection rates compared to single learning Intrusion Detection Systems. Dimensionality is one more serious concern which affects the performance of classification algorithms. Approaches such as ""Feature selection"" have been studied and adopted which selects a subset features from the feature set. However, the feature extraction approach for dimensionality reduction has proved to be better compared to feature selection and achieved better classification and detection rates. In this research, we address ""Feature extraction"" using ""Evolutionary feature clustering"" by proposing a ""Novel fuzzy membership function"" which addresses Dimensionality Reduction (DR). The idea is to transform the initial connection representation so that its equivalent representation has reduced noise affect and achieves better classification or detection rates. Experimental results on KDD datasets with 19 and 41 attributes, prove that the proposed approach has improved detection rates for R2L and U2R attack classes when compared to CANN, CLAPP, and SVM approaches. CANN approach recorded lower detection rates w.r.t U2R and R2L attacks.

To improve security author is using reluctant checksum (hash code) [4] while sending data and only destination can decode and compare data. While sending data first corrupted data will be added to message and only source and destination may know how to get original data from corrupted data and message integrity will be checked using UMAC hash code. Sender will generate checksum code and send code with message to receiver and then receiver once again generate code on received message, if same hash code generated [4] then message was not eavesdrop or alter by attacker. By adding corrupted messages attacker will have no clue to identify which part of message is original and which part is corrupted and without getting original message attacker cannot alter packet and security[6] will be improve.

Detecting arrhythmia from ECG signals is considered a standard approach and hence, automating this process would aid the diagnosis by providing fast, cost-efficient, and accurate solutions at scale. This is executed by extracting the definite properties from the individual patterns collected from Electrocardiography (ECG) signals causing arrhythmia. In this era of applied intelligence, automated detection and diagnostic solutions are widely used for their spontaneous and robust solutions. In this research, our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) method is implied to overhaul shift-invariance and aids signal reconstruction to extract significant features. Next, A neural attention mechanism is implied to capture temporal patterns from the extracted features of the ECG signal to discriminate distinct classes of arrhythmia and is trained end-to-end with the finest parameters. To ensure that the models generalizability, a set of five train-test variants are implied. The proposed model attains the highest accuracy of 98.5% for classifying 8 variants of arrhythmia on the MIT-BIH dataset. To test the resilience of the model, the unseen (test) samples are increased by 5x and the deviation in accuracy score and MSE was 0.12% and 0.1% respectively. Further, to assess the diagnostic model performance, AUC-ROC curves are plotted. At every test level, the proposed model is capable of generalizing new samples and leverages the advantage to develop a real-world application. As a note, this research is the first attempt to provide neural attention in arrhythmia classification using MIT-BIH ECG signals data with state-of-the-art performance.",Arrhythmia classification; arrhythmia detection; MIT-BIH dataset; dual-tree complex wave transform; ECG classification; neural attention; neural networks; deep learning,,,,2021-07-21,,,

Each parser has its own method of constructing a dependency tree. This paper describes the approaches for integrating transition and graph based parsers for parsing Telugu sentences. Combining these parsers at learning time is called Stacking and, at parsing time is called Ensembling. Stacking has two levels, level-0 and level-1. In level-0 model is trained under transition approach and generates the augmented trained data, which is used in level-1. The augmented data is then trained using graph based parser in level 1. It has shown better results when compared to the base parsers. Ensembled approach uses variations in base parsers, six variations of base parsers were built, among which four parsers are taken from transition based parsers and two parsers from graph based parsers. Majority, Attardi and Eisner are the three methods of Ensembled Approach which used for evaluating the parsing results. Majority approach has outperformed comparative with Attardi and Eisner methods. Different number of parsers are used for evaluating the performance, and obtained good results with three variations of base parsers, they are Covington projective, Covington non-projective and Non-projective second order features.

As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. In order to limit the spread of the disease, a fast and accurate diagnosis is required. A reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is often used to detect the disease. However, since this test is time-consuming, a chest computed tomography (CT) or plain chest X-ray (CXR) is sometimes indicated. The value of automated diagnosis is that it saves time and money by minimizing human effort. Three significant contributions are made by our research. Its initial purpose is to use the essential finetuning methodology to test the action and efficiency of a variety of vision models, ranging from Inception to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) networks. Second, by plotting class activation maps (CAMs) for individual networks and assessing classification efficiency with AUC-ROC curves, the behavior of these models is visually analyzed. Finally, stacked ensembles techniques were used to provide greater generalization by combining finetuned models with six ensemble neural networks. Using stacked ensembles, the generalization of the models improved. Furthermore, the ensemble model created by combining all of the finetuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art COVID-19 accuracy detection score of 99.17%.

It is widespread across the world, particularly in tropical regions, and if not treated in time, it can be deadly. Thus, early and effective treatment and diagnosis of malaria will save lives. Modern machine learning and image analysis methods are practiced on microscopic images of blood smears by using hand-crafted features that need expertise in interpreting these features. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to be adequate in feature extraction and classification of parasite detection toward malaria diagnosis. CNNs' techniques can extract highly influenced features, determine filters to serve as an effective prediction that provides an accurate detection to aid malaria diagnosis. The motivation of the research is to state the significance of deep learning techniques in the diagnosis of malaria. This research proposes the convolution Siamese network (CSN) for a one-shot recognition method for parasite recognition in microscopic images. In this study, microscopic images were used to examine the performance of the CSN model, and it will assist in diagnosing various infectious diseases rapidly. CSN is implemented in a two-phase criteria to detect similarity or dissimilarity. The first phase consists of extracting detailed features using a fully connected convolutional block and the second phase consists of a similarity check where inputs are discriminated with similarity measures (L1, L2). This discriminated feature is fed forward to the final layer with a sigmoid function that depicts whether it is similar to the given input. Further, the proposed model is evaluated to attain optimum generalization, and its performance is captured by splitting data into identical divisions (5050). As the model is trained only on half the malaria blood samples, it gives precisive generalization and attains malaria test accuracy scores of 87.10% and 87.38% with L1 and L2, respectively. We also depicted the mean square error (MSE) rate and confusion matrix for each to incorporate the performance for similar and dissimilar identification individually. The evolution of these metrics described the stability of the proposed network. Experiments and results have proven that the proposed CSN can leverage performance and build comprehensive models with fewer samples. The obtained result shows the potential of the Siamese network in the field of medical diagnostic tools. This research is the first study to construct and assess the Siamese network diagnostic model toward malaria diagnosis.","malaria, parasite, mosquito-borne, plasmodium, anopheles, diagnosis, machine learning, convolutional neural networks (cnns), microscopic images, feature extraction, classification, siamese network, medical diagnostic tools, blood smears, infectious diseases",,,,2021-01-01,,,

ReLU has some flaws, such as the fact that it is only active when the units are positive during back-propagation and zero otherwise. This causes neurons to die (dying ReLU) and a shift in bias. However, unlike ReLU activation functions, Swish activation functions do not remain stable or move in a single direction.

The known or closed-domain users may be internal employees of the organization, and unknown or open-domain users may be outside agencies, third-party users, etc. In the case of closed-domain users, the data owner becomes the key issuing authority, and in the case of open-domain users, various established attribute authorities perform the task of key issuance. Privacy preservation is also a crucial requirement in cloud-based data-sharing systems. This work proposes the SP-MAACS scheme, a secure and privacy-preserving multi-authority access control system for cloud-based healthcare data sharing. Both open and closed domain users are considered, and policy privacy is ensured by only disclosing the names of policy attributes. The values of the attributes are kept hidden. Characteristic comparison with similar existing schemes shows that our scheme simultaneously provides features such as multi-authority setting, expressive and flexible access policy structure, privacy preservation, and scalability. The performance analysis carried out by us shows that the decryption cost is reasonable enough. Furthermore, the scheme is demonstrated to be adaptively secure under the standard model.","electronic health records, access control, cloud storage, attribute-based encryption, multiple authorities, privacy preservation",,,,2023-02-27,,,

Its attributes as a non-toxic, low-carbon, and economical substitute for conventional cement concrete, coupled with its elevated compressive strength and reduced shrinkage properties, position it as a pivotal material for diverse applications spanning from architectural structures to transportation infrastructure. In this context, this study sets out the task of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to increase the accuracy and interpretability of predicting the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete in the civil engineering field. To achieve this goal, a new approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been adopted. This study focuses on creating a comprehensive dataset consisting of compositional and strength parameters of 162 geopolymer concrete mixes, all containing Class F fly ash. The selection of optimal input parameters is guided by two distinct criteria. The first criterion leverages insights garnered from previous research on the influence of individual features on compressive strength. The second criterion scrutinizes the impact of these features within the model's predictive framework. Key to enhancing the CNN model's performance is the meticulous determination of the optimal hyperparameters. Through a systematic trial-and-error process, the study ascertains the ideal number of epochs for data division and the optimal value of k for k-fold cross-validation--a technique vital to the model's robustness. The model's predictive prowess is rigorously assessed via a suite of performance metrics and comprehensive score analyses. Furthermore, the model's adaptability is gauged by integrating a secondary dataset into its predictive framework, facilitating a comparative evaluation against conventional prediction methods. To unravel the intricacies of the CNN model's learning trajectory, a loss plot is deployed to elucidate its learning rate. The study culminates in compelling findings that underscore the CNN model's accurate prediction of geopolymer concrete compressive strength. To maximize the dataset's potential, the application of bivariate plots unveils nuanced trends and interactions among variables, fortifying the consistency with earlier research. Evidenced by promising prediction accuracy, the study's outcomes hold significant promise in guiding the development of innovative geopolymer concrete formulations, thereby reinforcing its role as an eco-conscious and robust construction material. The findings prove that the CNN model accurately estimated geopolymer concrete's compressive strength. The results show that the prediction accuracy is promising and can be used for the development of new geopolymer concrete mixes. The outcomes not only underscore the significance of leveraging technology for sustainable construction practices but also pave the way for innovation and efficiency in the field of civil engineering.","geopolymer concrete, sustainable development, environmental problems, compressive strength, non-toxic, low-carbon, economical substitute, convolutional neural networks (cnns), machine learning (ml) algorithms, civil engineering, class f fly ash, hyperparameters, predictive framework, bivariate plots, sustainable construction practices",,,,2024-01-29,,,

The disease has spread to almost every nation and is still widespread worldwide. Early and reliable diagnosis is essential to prevent the development of this highly risky disease. The computer-aided diagnostic model facilitates medical practitioners in obtaining a quick and accurate diagnosis. To address these limitations, this study develops an optimized Xception convolutional neural network, called ""XCovNet,"" for recognizing COVID-19 from point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) images. This model employs a stack of modules, each of which has a slew of feature extractors that enable it to learn richer representations with fewer parameters. The model identifies the presence of COVID-19 by classifying POCUS images containing Coronavirus samples, viral pneumonia samples, and healthy ultrasound images. We compare and evaluate the proposed network with state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models such as VGG, DenseNet, Inception-V3, ResNet, and Xception Networks. By using the XCovNet model, the previous study's problems are cautiously addressed and overhauled by achieving 99.76% accuracy, 99.89% specificity, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.75% F1-score. To understand the underlying behavior of the proposed network, different tests are performed on different shuffle patterns. Thus, the proposed ""XCovNet"" can, in regions where test kits are limited, be used to help radiologists detect COVID-19 patients through ultrasound images in the current COVID-19 situation.","COVID-19,Depth-wise Convolution,POCUS,Separable Convolution,Xception,Ultrasound Images",,,,2023-09-23,,,

It causes catastrophic illness if left untreated for an extended period, and delaying exact treatment might result in the development of further complications. The most prevalent method now available for detecting malaria is the microscope. Under a microscope, blood smears are typically examined for malaria diagnosis. Despite its advantages, this method is time-consuming, subjective, and requires highly skilled personnel. Therefore, an automated malaria diagnosis system is imperative for ensuring accurate and efficient treatment. This research develops an innovative approach utilizing an urgent, inception-based capsule network to distinguish parasitized and uninfected cells from microscopic images. This diagnostic model incorporates neural networks based on Inception and Imperative Capsule networks. The inception block extracts rich characteristics from images of malaria cells using a pre-trained model, such as Inception V3, which facilitates efficient representation learning. Subsequently, the dynamic imperative capsule neural network detects malaria parasites in microscopic images by classifying them into parasitized and healthy cells, enabling the detection of malaria parasites. The experiment results demonstrate a significant improvement in malaria parasite recognition. Compared to traditional manual microscopy, the proposed system is more accurate and faster.

In todays technological age, computational methods are available, and they may assist the companys top leaders in making sound decisions and strengthening the organization. There are several techniques for dealing with decision-making problems, one of which is the use of Hendecagonal fuzzy numbers. These fuzzy numbers are used to represent the ambiguity or ambiguity of eleven linguistic variables. To address these shortcomings, we use the ranking method, relativity function, and comparison matrix to aid in decision-making because we have eleven constraints (linguistic variables) that can be expressed in a hendecagonal fuzzy number matrix (HdcgFNM).

If these systems can capture basic linguistic information, then the usefulness of these statistical systems improves a lot. This paper is an attempt at incorporating linguistic constraints in statistical dependency parsing. We consider a simple linguistic constraint that a verb should not have multiple subjects or direct objects as its children in the dependency tree. We first describe the importance of this constraint considering machine translation systems which use dependency parser output, as an example application. We then show how the current state-of-the-art dependency parsers violate this constraint. We describe two methods to handle this constraint. We evaluate our methods on the state-of-the-art dependency Telugu parser. Our results show that we can build a statistical parser which handles linguistic constraints and thus be more useful in real-world applications without compromising accuracy.","dependency parsing, Telugu language, statistical parsing, linguistic constraints, machine learning, position-based approach, score-based approach, malt parser, Telugu treebank, natural language parsing, usability",,,,2016-09-12,,,

In this paper we are developing Facial expression recognition system (FER) by using deep learning technique. Every person will be interested to know about the emotion of a person by his face gestures, to know the emotions, so many techniques are developed in the existing, and here we are using AFBN and GFBN from the DNN. In the AFBN the given image will be converted into LBP image after performing the pre-processing and then CNN will be applied to the output image. In GFBN the action units (AU) calculated when there is change in facial expressions. In this paper the proposed method mainly focuses on combining these two results by Softmax function to finding the error. The Top-2 error will be considered, and it is called as second highest emotion. Whenever to calculate all the emotions of a person there must be image with neutral emotions and it will be generated by using auto-encoder technique. After getting the data of neutral image we can easily get. The output results are compared with previous methods to know the efficiency of proposed method.

This article presents a detailed summary of ML approaches as they have been used to predict and anticipate sports injuries to this point in time. The research conducted over the last five years has been collated, and its results have been untaken. Assuming the present absence of accessible sources, standardized statistics, and a dependence on obsolete deterioration prototypes, it is impossible to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the real-world effectiveness of machine learning in terms of its application to the prediction of sports injuries. However, it has been hypothesized that resolving these two problems would make it possible to deploy innovative, strong machine-learning architectures, which will hasten the process of increasing the state of this area while also offering proven clinical tools.","Sports Injury Detection, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.",,,,2024-01-01,,,

FACTS Controllers are most effective devices to ensure system security by enhancing the stability margins with reactive power support all over the power system network. The major shunt compensation devices of FACTS are SVC and STATCOM. This article dispenses the modelling and simulation of both the shunt devices viz. Oneis the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and the other is Static Var Compensator (SVC). The small signal models of these devices have been derived from the first principles and obtained the transfer function models of weak and strong power systems. The weak power system has the Short Circuit Ratio (SCR) is about less than 3 and that of the strong power system has the SCR of more than 5. The performance of the both weak and strong power systems has been evaluated with time and frequency responses. The dynamic response is obtained with the exact models for both weak and strong systems, subsequently the root locus plots as well as bode plots have been obtained with MATLAB Programs and evaluated the performance of these devices and comparison is made. The Stability margins of both the systems with SVC and STATCOM have been obtained from the bode plots. The dynamic behaviour of the both kinds of power systems have been assessed with time responses of SVC and STATCOM models. All of these results viz. dynamic response, root locus and bode plots proves the superiority of the STATCOM over SVC with indices, viz. peak overshoot, settling time, gain margin and phase margins. The dynamic, steady state performance indices obtained from time response and bode plots proves the superior performance of STATCOM.","Performance evaluation,Analytical models,Power system dynamics,Stability criteria,Static VAr compensators,Transfer functions,Power system stability",,,,2022-03-25,,,

Computer vision has many different parts, such as recognising images, finding objects, making images, making images bigger, and more. Object detection in real time is a big, busy, and hard area of computer vision. Object detection is when more than one object needs to be found in an image. Image localization is when there is only one object to find in an image. This finds the objects of a class that make sense in digital pictures and videos. Real-time object detection can be used for many things, such as tracking objects, video surveillance, recognising pedestrians, counting people, self-driving cars, recognising faces, following a ball in sports, and many more. As deep learning grows quickly, more powerful tools that can learn semantic, high-level, and deeper features are made available to solve problems in traditional architectures. The network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function of these models are all different. Convolution neural network is an example of a deep learning tool that can be used to find objects with OpenCV, which is a library of programming functions that are mostly used for real-time computer vision. Most accidents happen because of things that get in the way, like other people, cars, people, fire hydrants, traffic signs, and so on. This is mostly about finding these kinds of problems that can lead to disaster.","OpenCV,Object detection,Convolution neural network,Computer vision,Machine learninginger Nature Singapore",,,,2022-11-18,,,

Discovering suitable cloud services for the end user is incredibly complex and difficult. The cloud brokerage service is an application that aids in providing solutions for this problem. It recommends suitable cloud service providers to the end users depending on their relevant requirements. The Internet provides access to a wide variety of cloud brokers. As a result, choosing a cloud broker or service provider is both time-consuming and tedious. It is now becoming a necessity to choose a proper cloud brokerage service based on trust. Research works found in the literature address some of the issues and provide feasible solutions by proposing frameworks, optimizations and rule based algorithms. However, those works focus solely on delivering a trustworthy service to the end user through application of techniques and algorithms. There is no proper framework model in place to provide suitable and trustworthy recommended services to the users. This article provides a detailed description of the frameworks that are offered by the researchers, including issues and proposes a trustworthy recommendation framework (TRF) to provide trustworthy services to the end user. This article also presents a Trustworthy Recommended Weighted value (TRWv) approach for determining trustworthy services, and it is discovered that the proposed method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) when compared to similar works.","cloud broker, cloud service provider, end user, recommendation framework, logistic regression",,,,2022-12-23,,,

Achieving better accuracies by applying benchmark classifier algorithms used for identifying intrusions and anomalies have several hidden data mining challenges. Although neglected by many research findings, one of the most important and biggest challenges is the similarity or membership computation. Another challenge that cannot be simply neglected is the number of features that attributes to dimensionality. This research aims to come up with a new membership function to carry similarity computation that can be helpful for addressing feature dimensionality issues. In principle, this work is aimed at introducing a novel membership function that can help to achieve better classification accuracies and eventually lead to better intrusion and anomaly detection. Experiments are performed on KDD dataset with 41 attributes and also KDD dataset with 19 attributes. Recent approaches CANN and CLAPP have showed new approaches for intrusion detection. The proposed classifier is named as UTTAMA. UTTAMA performed better to both CANN and CLAPP approaches w.r.t overall classifier accuracy. Another promising outcome achieved using UTTAMA is the U2R and R2L attack accuracies. The importance of proposed approach is that the accuracy achieved using proposed approach outperforms CLAPP, CANN, SVM, KNN and other existing classifiers.","Anomaly,Intrusion,Classifier,Outlier,Clustering,Dimensionality,Feature extraction",,,GRK-JPUB-019,2019-03-05,,,

Analytics has evolved as a major area and has been significantly helping organizations from years to get profitable business results. Organizations are now employing Business Intelligence tools and techniques to analyze their large complex volumes of data. Even though analytic tools and techniques are employed still many organizations are failing to come up with the right business decisions. This is because either they do not have the proper process model or they do not use a systematic process model for decision making. According to Gartner, on average sixty percent of the organizations are still not able to make fruitful decisions due to various factors like, data quality issues, lack of careful consideration of components involved, skill shortage to name a few. In this paper, we consider the software process, which is one of the key factors and show how a software process model may be applied to Business Intelligence process by defining the entire BI process as a two stage software component process model which internally involves other components. For this purpose, we have defined two software process component models for the entire BI process. We also emphasize all the key considerations that need to be followed to achieve successful BI results. We throw light on how the sequential iteration phase can be applied at each component level. This model serves as a prototype for the future BI projects which can benefit organizations and top decision makers in making quality decisions.","organizations, analytics, business intelligence, decision making, gartner, data quality, components, software process, model, bi process, iteration phase, prototype, projects, top decision makers, quality decisions",,,GRK-CPUB-024,2015-09-24,,,

Hence, the need arises to protect VoIP services from all kinds of attacks that target network bandwidth, server capacity or server architectural constrains. SIP Protocol is used for VoIP connection establishment. It works based on either TCP or UDP Protocols. This protocol structure is almost as same as HTTP Protocol, i.e., for every request there will be some response, even though the request is invalid. HTTP Protocol is prone to flooding attacks, like SYN-Flood attack. Because of SIP is same as HTTP, SIP is also prone to Flooding attacks. The proposed VoIP Flood Detection System (VFDS) is aimed to detect TCP Flooding attacks and SIP Flooding attacks on SIP devices using Jacobian Fast and Hellinger distance algorithms. The Jacobian Fast Algorithm fixes the threshold limit and Hellinger distance calculation is a statistical anomaly based algorithm uses to detect deviation in traffic.","VoIP, attacks in VoIP, flood attacks, IP telephony, jacobian fast, hellinger distance.",,,GRK-JPUB-025,2011-05-31,,,

Not every blind person can have a guide. This thought prompted us to work on a project called scene recognition and narration in which the application will recognize and understand the scene presented and dynamically give a verbal output. This application will help in the reduction of accidents and help make the lives of blind people just a little easier. The findings appear to provide good evidence that using widely accessible dense building blocks to approximate the predicted ideal sparse structure is a feasible technique for enhancing neural networks for computer vision. There are two more advantages to this architecture: One is that the number of units in each step is greatly increased, yet the computational complexity is kept under control. A significant number of input filters can be shielded from the final step to the next layer when dimensionality reduction is used widely. Second, visual data is processed on several scales and then aggregated so that the following phase may extract characteristics from many scales at the same time. YOLO Algorithm is used for the proposed architecture.","impaired, sight, blind, guide, scene recognition, narration, application, accidents, neural networks, computer vision, architecture, dimensionality reduction, visual data, scales, yolo algorithm",,,GRK-CPUB-027,2021-12-14,,,

Many web applications having vulnerabilities due to poor implementation of security measures. These web applications will be deployed without fixing the vulnerabilities thus becomes vulnerable to many cyber-attacks. Simple attacks like brute-force and NoSQL injection could give unauthorized access to the user accounts. This leads to user privacy issues which could create huge loss to the organizations. These vulnerabilities can be fixed by implementing the necessary security measures while developing the web application. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit organization which gives the severity, impact and prevention methods about Top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. This research deals with the implementation of bestsecurity practices for Node.js web applications in detail. This research paper proposes the security mechanisms for attacks related to front-end, middleware and backend web development using OWASP suggestions. The main focus of this research paper is on prevention of Denial-of-service attack, Brute force attack, NoSQL injection attack and Unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The proposed prevention methods are implemented in a web application to test the defensive mechanisms against the mentionedvulnerabilities.","Privacy,Java,Force,Organizations,Market research,Application security,Microelectronics

Hence this has achieved significant contribution from several medical domain researchers. Several data mining researchers have proposed various methods and approaches to impute missing values. However very few of them concentrate on dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we discuss a novel imputation framework for missing values imputation. Our approach of filling missing values is rooted on class based clustering approach and essentially aims at medical records dimensionality reduction. We use these dimensionality records for carrying prediction and classification analysis.

The imputation is then followed by classification of medical records. We discuss a case study to show the process of imputation and classification of records using the proposed approach.

One cannot eliminate missing values in medical records. The reason may be because some tests may not been conducted as they are cost effective, values missed when conducting clinical trials, values may not have been recorded to name some of the reasons. Data mining researchers have been proposing various approaches to find and impute missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation approach for fixing missing values. The approach is based on clustering concept and aims at dimensionality reduction of the records. This serves the need to use the same records of lower dimension to be used for clustering and classification of medical records to arrive at accurate decision prediction. The case study discussed shows that the missing values can be fixed and imputed efficiently by achieving dimensionality reduction.

Breast cancer is one of the dreadful cancers accounting for a large portion of deaths caused due to cancer worldwide mostly affecting women, needs early detection for proper diagnosis, and subsequent decrease in death rate. Thus, for efficient classification, we implemented different ML techniques on Wisconsin dataset [1] namely SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes using accuracy as a performance metric, and as per observance, SVM has shown better results when compared to other algorithms. Also, we worked on Breast Histopathology Images [2] scanned at 40x which had images of IDC which is one of the most common types of breast cancers. And to work with the image dataset along with EDA we used high-end techniques like a mobile net where smote a resampling was used to handle imbalanced class distribution, CNN, SVC, Inception Res Net V2 where frameworks like Tensor Flow, Keras were loaded for supporting the environment and smoothly implement the algorithms.","Breast cancer, IDC (Invasive ductal cancer), Histopathology Images, Tensor Flow, Keras, CNN, SVC, InceptionResNetV2, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Wisconsin dataset.",,,,2021-10-30,,,

Regular high utility itemsets mining methods for static databases cannot be applied to incremental databases. An efficient method called RHUINC miner (Regular High Utility Itemset mining for the incremental database) is proposed for discovering regular high utility itemsets from incremental databases. It uses uList structure to avoid the creation of unpromising itemsets. Using uList, it can maintain the itemsets information and provide efficient strategies to generate regular high utility itemsets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of runtime and memory utilization.","high utility itemset mining, itemsets, profits, regular high utility itemsets, static databases, real-world applications, occurrence behavior, new transactions, incremental databases, rhuinc miner, ulist structure, itemsets information, efficient strategies, experimental results, runtime and memory utilization",,,,2021-08-01,,,

In this study, we used a Filtered Classifier on text documents that has passed through an arbitrary filter. To classify the text documents C4.5 classifier was used, the structure of the filter is based on training and testing data sets that are processed by the filter without changing the structural behavior. In addition, Fayyad and Irani's discretization method is used as a preprocessing that discretize a range of numerical attributes in the text document data set into nominal attributes. For classification, we use C4.5 decision tree classifier. Four datasets such as CNAE-9, 20 Newsgroups, Twitter and Reuter-21578 were employed to test the unseen test documents and test the efficiency of the Filtered Classifier. Experimentation is described in detail and the results show improved classifier accuracy for classification.","information technology, electronic documents, automatic classification, data repositories, algorithms, filtered classifier, text documents, c4 5 classifier, training and testing data sets, fayyad and irani's discretization method, decision tree classifier, datasets, efficiency, experimentation, classifier accuracy",,,,2017-12-14,,,

The basic Quality of Service requirements expected by many application scenarios of WMSNs are throughput, packet loss ratio, reliability, node energy and network life time. In order to satisfy these requirements, routing protocols of WMSNs has to concentrate on minimum energy route for data forwarding. Link quality analysis together with energy parameters is one of the major techniques for electing energy aware and reliable route path in WMSN. Sending multimedia data via dynamically changing wireless links adds the trust of each node in data forwarding as an important factor in route selection. The main feature of the paper is to predict the energy efficient reliable path for data forwarding using optimal forward node selection approach. With the aim of selecting the optimal forwarding node by means of link quality, energy and trust, a Link Quality based Energy and Trust Aware Routing Protocol (LQETA-RP) for WMSNs is proposed in this paper. In LQETA-RP, hardware and software based link performance indicators namely Link Quality Indicator, Received Signal Strength Indicator, Expected Transmission count and Trust based Link Cost Function (TLCF) are used for predicting the reliable and energy efficient route. TLCF for each node in the forwarding path leads to minimum energy utilization in route discovery and confirms very least packet drop ratio up to 10%. Simulation of the LQETA-RP is done using NS3 and the results were compared with the existing protocols namely EEPLQRR, LQER, LQEAR and TERP it shows that, Nodes energy consumption is saved by 3040%, throughput increased by 1015% and packet loss ratio is minimized in 3040% approximately.","wireless multimedia sensor networks, wmsns, routing protocols, quality of service, energy, reliability, node energy, network life time, link quality analysis, multimedia data, wireless links, trust, forward node selection, link quality based energy and trust aware routing protocol, lqeta-rp, hardware, software, link performance indicators, link quality indicator, received signal strength indicator, expected transmission count, trust based link cost function, tlcf, energy efficient, route discovery, packet drop ratio, ns3, eeplqrr, lqer, lqear, terp, energy consumption, throughput, packet loss ratio.",,,,2023-02-06,,,

In large-scale networks, it is challenging to detect the communities by learning the distinct properties of the graph. As deep learning has made contributions in a variety of domains, we try to use deep learning techniques to mine the knowledge from large-scale graph networks. In this paper, we aim to provide a strategy for detecting communities using deep autoencoders and obtain generic neural attention to graphs. The advantages of neural attention are widely seen in the field of NLP and computer vision, which has low computational complexity for large-scale graphs. The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. Firstly, a transformer is utilized to downsample the first-order proximities of the graph into a latent space, which can result in the structural properties and eventually assist in detecting the communities. Secondly, the fine-tuning task is conducted by tuning variant hyperparameters cautiously, which is applied to multiple social networks (Facebook and Twitch). Furthermore, the objective function (crossentropy) is tuned by L0 regularization. Lastly, the reconstructed model forms communities that present the relationship between the groups. The proposed robust model provides good generalization and is applicable to obtaining not only the community structures in social networks but also the node classification. The proposed graph-transformer shows advanced performance on the social networks with the average NMIs of 0.67±0.04, 0.198±0.02,",Social networks; graph transformer; community detection; graph classification,,,,2022-03-01,,,

Precognitive diagnoses are characterized by lightheadedness, nausea, severe fatigue, and an elevated heart rate. As a result, its important to seek care as soon as possible after experiencing syncope. Since receiving a correct diagnosis and appropriate care, the majority of patients may avoid complications with syncope. Syncope appears to be a sign of COVID 19 in people with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, a sudden heart attack might result in acute syncope. In a few circumstances, machine learning classification techniques may not be precise. For paraplegia patients, prediction vasovagal syncope needs more precise results in order to save their lives.

It combines the main advantages of ID-based PKC (no certificate) and traditional PKC (no escrow), while at the same time, has none of the drawback of either. Recently, Xiaoqin Shen,proposed a new CL-S scheme, which he claimed was the first CL-S that is strongly unforgeable without the use of random oracles, i.e., in the standard model. Although he claimed that his scheme has stronger security than the previous scheme, his scheme is not secure against the key replacement attack. Moreover, Shen?s CL-S scheme is insecure against a malicious-butpassive KGC attack In this research work, however, it will bepointed out that Shen?s scheme is insecure against public key replacement attack (PKRA) and malicious-but-passive KGC attack (MKGCA). Furthermore, an improved scheme has been proposed that overcomes has shortcomings in his scheme due to security flaws while at the same time, improving upon the merits of the original scheme. It not only preserves the advantages of Shen?s scheme such as shorter system parameters and higher computational efficiency than the existing related works, but also improves the efficiency of Shen?s schemes by reducing the signature size.

As far as Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryptions (HIBE) concern, it is rational to view the root PKG (Private Key Generator) as a trusted party or being unconditionally trusted, but those level PKGs should be treated suspiciously in hierarchical identity based setting. To achieve the full security, existing schemes suffers a security degradation exponential in the hierarchy depth. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption with maximum hierarchy extension to Boneh IBE under Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption in standard security model. To overcome key escrow problem challenge in HIBE, we proposed a new method that overcomes key escrow by having maximum Hierarchy length.

Due to the continuous motion of the node, handoffs between different APs are necessary to remain connected. This work proposes a location-based handoff method which will minimize handoff latency and provide better connections. The location-based handoff mechanism uses the concept of placing an access point (AP) at the predetermined locations. Handoff is triggered at the location where the AP (access point) is located and a connection is made to the new AP based on the channel information obtained. The architecture used in this scenario is WiMAX architecture and connections are maintained with the help of routers contained within the mobile stations.

Generally in authentication a client and server agree upon a cryptographic key which is mutually exchanged. Earlier passwords were stored in a single server where if an intruder gains access of that server by some malicious attacks then all the passwords stored in the database are to be compromised and therefore the e-commerce application security is endangered. In-order to improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication mechanisms we involve multiple servers to store the passwords and participate in key-exchange and authentication process so as to ensure that even a single server is compromised the whole systems security is not in threat and also generating a nonce values randomly for every session corresponds to a two level security mechanism where the scope of an attacker to pretend as the legitimate user and login into the system is completely restricted. In this model the passwords are stored in their equivalent hash values and they are spitted into multiple servers. Making it even more difficult for the attacker to determine the password even by reverse engineering he cannot intercept the actual password form segments of hash value. Hence, we can present this model as safe and secure password based authentication scheme using key exchange mechanism.","Authentication, Cryptography, Key exchange.

Our protocol is robust means even t KPA's (out of n = 21 + 1) are corrupted or dishonest the user recover the private key. This protocol can be efficient even if the communication between authorities (KGC and KPAs) is insecure. This approach is useful and offer benefits that are in identity-based techniques, while eliminating key escrow from the setup. In this protocol, either KGC or KPA cannot cheat the users to obtain their private keys. Security analysis of proposed protocol and active adversary assumptions are also presented.","ID-Based cryptography,

In SCM, a hopeful solution for secured information sharing (IS) is blockchain technology. Nevertheless, it is a bit crucial to maintain security at all levels of blockchain, and therefore private and public-key cryptography is often favored. This study improves the security and privacy of a suggested ""blockchain assisted supply chain management (SCM),"" in which ""Modified Data Sanitization and Data Restoration"" is performed with an ideal key generation technique to retain sensitive data in each block. The major challenge that must be overcome to make data transmission security is optimal key selection.

High resolution images are used for different geographical applications. Using geographical objects or spatial objects for analysis became prevalent in the contemporary era. Many supervised classification techniques came into existence to have efficient classification of high-resolution imagery. There are many factors that may affect classification of geographic images. They include the presence of mixed objects, feature selection, size of training set and segmentation scale. When these factors are considered for a systematic mining of images with high resolution, it results in improved performance. Especially in agricultural environments, it is essential to have such study to ascertain which supervised learning mechanism can best deal with the factors aforementioned. An algorithm named Feature Subset Selection (FSS) is defined to enhance classification accuracy. Different classification techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Adaboost.M1 and Decision Table (DT) are used for the empirical study with spatial data mining.

Different layers in this architecture so that users can use all the resource in cloud as a service model.In this environment cloud storage service is one of the most popular in present world. Data sharing is an important functionality in cloud storage the data placed by user may be shared and accessed by many users in such a case the data sharing must be secure, flexible and efficient with other cloud computing overlap many existing concepts such as a distributed systems. Data security is a challenging issue in cloud computing paradigm user to store sensitive information on cloud servers. Data confidentiality cloud server is required, when users outsource data storage in cloud. Existing solutions generally use cryptographic solutions like encryption and decryption. Cloud data storage is the data integrity verification at untrusted server. To preserve data privacy, is a basic solution to encrypt data files, and then upload the encrypted data into the cloud. For this it is proposed a public key cryptosystem for storing and accessing for data in cloud. In existing system cryptosystem produce the constant size cipher text. Now system proposes to introduce variable size cryptosystem supported with a set of secret keys as a single key and the process use the power of all the keys by using this aggregate key we encrypt the files and storing in cloud.

Each sequence in sequence dataset is composed of time ordered events and each event is an item set. It discovers all frequent subsequences having frequency greater than the given minimum support threshold. Discovering sequential patterns is expensive with respect to mining time as well as the amount of memory used, because of aggressive search space growth due to generation of explosive number of frequent subsequences with the sequence length as well as count of distinct items and large volume of sequence dataset. So, research in this domain aims at developing effective data structures which address frequency counting and large search space as well as scalable algorithms to reduce the execution time and the amount of memory utilized. We propose two efficient data structures called Pre-order Post-order Coded Aggregate Tree (PPCA-Tree) for compact representation of the sequence dataset and Root-node List of First-Occurrence Sub Trees Map (RLFOST-Map) for efficient representation of projected databases. We also developed an efficient Partially ordered Sequential PAttern Mining algorithm called PSPAM and Parallel implementation of Partially ordered Sequential PAttern Mining algorithm called PAPSPAM based on PPCA-Tree using RLFOST-Map which eliminates reconstruction of the projecteddatabases.

This work introduces a new method known as Wavelet Deep Convolutional Neural Network (WDCNN) to classify cyber-attacks. The presented network combines WDCNN with Enhanced Rain Optimization Algorithm (EROA) to minimize the loss in the network. This proposed algorithm is designed to detect attacks in large-scale data and reduces the complexities of detection with maximum detection accuracy. The proposed method is implemented in PYTHON. The classification process is completed with the help of the two most famous datasets, KDD cup 1999 and CICMalDroid 2020. The performance of WDCNN_EROA can be assessed using parameters like specificity, accuracy, precision F-measure and recall. The results showed that the proposed method is about 98.72% accurate for the first dataset and 98.64% for the second dataset.","Cyber-attackswavelet, deep convolutional neural network,Rain optimization algorithm,wavelet pooling,intrusion detection,deep learning,network security

increased the significance of the creation of sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDS). Big data may
be handled through deep learning, which has demonstrated excellent performance in several disciplines. As
a result, security professionals want to use deep learning in intrusion detection systems. This subject has
been the subject of a great deal of research, which has produced a wide variety of methods. To categorise
network traffic, the majority of these methods employ predetermined characteristics that have been
retrieved by specialists.However most of the methods are incapable of effectively classifying the intrusion.
To solve this problem, this research introduced a novel deep learning method to effectively classify the
intrusion with lesser delay. Using a multi-level clustering strategy that includes the k-nearest neighbour,
reverse k-nearest neighbour and k-means clustering approach, the undesirable information and outliers in
the data may be eliminated. The Adversarially Regularised Parallel Deep Transfer Network (AR-PDTN) is
then used to classify the IoT data intrusion in order to identify any network irregularities. The parameters of
the proposed neural network model will then be appropriately adjusted using Alpine skiing optimisation.
Five independent datasets like CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, KDDCup99, UNSW-NB15 and BOT-IOT were
utilised to categorise the incursion. In the results section, the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of the
proposed model are contrasted with those of several other current models.The proposed model achieved
99.3% accuracy in UNSW-NB15 dataset, 99.7% in CICIDS2017, 99.1% in NSL-KDD dataset, 99.8%

framework was the best when compared with each dataset. In this research, an Adversarially Regularized

In relevance to Cloud Computing, the task of identification of DDoS attacks is a significantly challenging problem because of computational complexity that has to be addressed. Fundamentally, a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an intentional attack attempted by attackers from single source which has an implicit intention of making an application unavailable to the target stakeholder. For this to be achieved, attackers usually stagger the network bandwidth, halting system resources, thus causing denial of access for legitimate users. Contrary to DoS attacks, in DDoS attacks, the attacker makes use of multiple sources to initiate an attack. DDoS attacks are most common at network, transportation, presentation and application layers of a seven-layer OSI model.

Although, DDoS attacks in cloud are not new but still they have been continuously throwing new challenges to the network community which makes detection of these attacks an ongoing research challenge with respect to cloud security. One of the reasons for these challenges is the high non-linearity of the real-world data. Thus, we bring into light the importance of understanding the non-linearity of data. Understanding nature of traffic instances in network datasets helps to build efficient machine learning models. For building a machine learning model, we choose to apply regression analysis. Two datasets namely CICIDS 2017 and CICIDS 2019 are considered for the present study as these datasets show high non-linearity. In this paper, we propose to apply regression analysis after performing feature engineering addressing the problem of DDoS attack detection. We propose to visualize the regression model by plotting residual plot, fit chart. The learning models can also be evaluated by comparing their respective MAPE and accuracy values. To the best of our knowledge, the research addressed in this paper is the first contribution in cloud computing which depicts the importance data visualization in analyzing the machine learning models.

For instance, DDoS attacks in cloud are continuously throwing new challenges to network community which makes detection of these attacks, an ongoing research challenge with respect to cloud security.

For experimental study, the most recent benchmark dataset namely IoT DoS and DDoS attack dataset available at IEEE Dataport is considered as this dataset has highly non-linear traffic instances which are like the real-world traffic. The performance evaluation of the proposed machine learning model SWASTHIKA is done by considering various classifier evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision, detection rate, and F-Score.

This approach generates a large number of candidate itemsets which are not actual high utility itemsets thus causing memory and time overhead to process them.

In addition, the performance analysis based on Efficiency, Reliability, Quality of solution, and superiority of DMS algorithm over other top 10 algorithms are examined. From analysis, the DMS provides better efficiency as it endeavours less computational effort to generate better solution, due to acquisition of both DA and MS algorithm's benefits and DMS takes less time to process a task. Moreover, the DMS needs less number of iterations in the process of optimization and helps to stop optimization process in local optimum. In addition, the DMS has better reliability as it poses the potential to handle specific level of performance. In addition, the DMS utilizes heuristic information for attaining high reliability.

In big data era, analysis and extraction of knowledge from huge-scale data sets is a key issue in the research due to the complexity in the analysis of big data. Numerous techniques are devised for streaming big data. However, the techniques are highly dynamic, which may result in concept drift. Accordingly, this paper introduces a technique based on optimization for handling the concept drift effectively. The proposed dragonfly moth search (DMS) algorithm-based spark architecture is developed for handling the big data stream classification without any concept drift. Specifically, big data stream classification is done based on the proposed DMS-based stacked auto-encoder (SAE) in spark and the big data stream classification involves two phases, namely online phase and offline phase. The incremental data is tackled effectively in the online phase, where the concept drift is checked based on error, and in case of any concept drift, the rough set theory is employed, which is defined, based on DMS algorithm. The proposed DMS algorithm is the integration of dragonfly algorithm (DA) and moth search algorithm (MS), which aims at feature selection and optimal tuning of the SAE","Big data streaming

According to their cutting-edge efficiency, fully convolutional networks have replaced other common algorithms in the domain of semantic categorization. Nevertheless, a broad FCN typically yields uniform and slick outcomes. Additionally, characteristics for some subcategories cannot be properly examined by FCN whenever the semantics categorization in collections, such as the face classification issue, is excessively imbalanced. To solve these issues, a pyramidal FCN initially encodes a face picture into multi-level characteristic mappings. Next, the characteristics of the various facial characteristics are retrieved independently using the enclosing box that a one-stage detecting head provides. The retrieved characteristics are processed by 3 category sub-networks to produce the appropriate segmentation accuracy. Direct decoding of the layer of skin is possible first from pyramidal FCN's rear end. The total segmented output is then produced by integrating the several sections. Furthermore, the suggested approach, which was tested on a database with only one face labelled row, may be utilized immediately to carry out complex multi-facial classification tasks without requiring any networking modifications or extra modules or data. With a modest size of the networking, the entire system can be taught from beginning to finish (12 MB). Studies demonstrate that the suggested strategy can produce more precise (one or multiple) facial labelling outcomes in comparison to earlier efforts and achieves cutting-edge outcomes inside the HELEN facial database","facial labelling, edge-to-edge identification, convolutional networks, semantic categorization, fcn, imbalanced collections, pyramidal fcn, multi-level characteristic mappings, subcategories, segmentation accuracy, skin layer decoding, multi-facial classification, networking modifications, helen facial database",,,,2023-05-12,,,

Even before radiologists and other specialized medical professionals determine whether a lung nodule exists or not, the danger increases as time increases. The demand for Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems to accurately classify lung nodules into malignant or benign types has arisen as a result of improvements in medical imaging techniques like Computed Tomography (CT) scans, as this prevents delays in lung nodule diagnosis. In order to identify the lung nodule and deliver better and more prompt timely therapy, a new deep learning-based Lung Nodule Detection Model (LNDM) is created in this paper. Lung nodule detection and image collection make up the ideal functions of the created model. The lung nodule images are initially gathered from the common standard datasets. Then, the acquired images are used with Multiscale Hybrid 2D-3D Dilation assisted Adaptive Trans-Res-UNet++ (MHD-ATRes-UNet++) approaches for lung nodule diagnosis. This method combines ResNet and UNet++ with a Multiscale mechanism, a 2D-3D dilation layer, and an adaptive transformer layer. The Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) and the Levy Flight Distribution Algorithm (LFD) are combined to generate a Population-based Levy Flight Distribution-Golden Eagle Optimization (PLFD-GEO) algorithm, which is used in this instance to detect lung nodules.

On the other hand, business intelligence (BI) tools ensure to predict and analyse the historical data with the current data, to predict the events of a business operation. Thismethod seems to be more complex due to the involvement of large data from the millions of the customers. Using the data mining techniques along with DM and BI, the data can be processed effectively so as to deliver accurate decisions. In this work, application of customer leaving in the telecom industry is tested for prediction of customer behaviour using data mining techniques. Large number of data sets will be process from the telecom industry by introducing a unique method by combining hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as HGAPSO, which allows extracting specific and useful data. By using the advantages of both the methods, one can accurately determine the decisions from the customer churn predictions using auxiliary vector classification method. The performance metrics in this work considered accuracy, true positive response rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), time complexity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results from this work delivered high scalability using HGAPSO and well suited for predictions in the area of business analysis","CRM, BI, DM systems, Attribute Selection,

In this work, a unique system is built to reveal the information of the image based on its category and relevant labels associated with it. To accomplish this task different data mining techniques are used for image classifications using Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm is constructed with the help of grey level features and along with some of the colour features. Grey level features include speed up robust features (SURF), maximum stable external regions (MESR) and improved colour coherence vector (ICCV). Apart from that different techniques involved in data mining are being used includes neural networks (NN), decision trees (DT), Bayesian networks (BN), discriminant analysis (DA) and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). These techniques are used to evaluate the datasets included with Corel-1000 and COIL-100. BN and DA outperformed other methods as they are achieved a specificity of 99.9%, sensitivity of 99.5% and accuracy of 99.4% for Coral-1000.

A important challenge on this line is to deal with the distinctive characteristics of travel information, which distinguish travel packages from ancient things for recommendation. thereto finish, during this paper, we tend to 1st analyze the characteristics of the present travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST)model. This TAST model will represent travel packages and tourists by completely different topic distributions, wherever the subject extraction is conditioned on each the tourists and therefore the intrinsic options (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, supported this subject model illustration, we tend to propose a cocktail approach to get the lists for customized travel package recommendation. moreover, we tend to extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in every travel cluster. Finally, we tend to measure the TAST model, the TRAST model, and therefore the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel bag info. pilot results display that the TAST model will effectively capture the distinctive characteristics of the travel information and therefore the cocktail approach is, thus, rather more effective than ancient recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering traveler relationships, the TRAST model are often used as a good assessment for travel cluster formation.","recommender systems, travel packages, personalized recommendation, tast model, tourist-area-season topic, cocktail approach, trast model, latent relationships, real-world travel data, pilot results, travel cluster formation, unique characteristics, ancient recommendation techniques, tourist relationships, landscape features",,,,2015-05-01,,,

However, one cannot ignore the challenges involved using the technology linked with large amount of data and internet applications (i.e., cloud). One of the biggest challenges cloud computing faces is security breaching and related issues.

The disruptive quality of SDN allows the management of network nodes using a software program from a remote location, making them more effective than a traditional system. However, edge computing allows a massive number of devices at the edge for communicating with the SDN. Traditional networks are unable to handle the increasing number of mobile devices and other peripherals required to process big data. The elastic nature of SDN-enabled edge computing to deal with IoT makes it more significant as a norm for dealing with robust events, activities and data. This chapter discusses a detailed SDN-based IoT architecture with edge computing that offers a successful and robust environment to deal with billions of devices in a meaningful and secured manner.

In this paper, text mining is performed using average-stochastic gradient descent weight-dropped (AWD)- LSTM techniques to obtain better accuracy and performance. The proposed model is effectively demonstrated by considering the internet movie database (IMDB) reviews. To implement the proposed model Python language was used due to easy adaptability and flexibility while dealing with massive data sets/databases. From the results, it is seen that the proposed LSTM plus weight dropped plus embedding model demonstrated an accuracy of 88.36% as compared to the previous models of AWD LSTM as 85.64. This result proved to be far better when compared with the results obtained by just LSTM model (with 85.16%) accuracy.

The energy of cluster heads (CHs) that are adjacent to the base station (BS) gets depleted because of traffic load at high inter-cluster relay in the multi-hop approach and the issue of hot spot arises. Therefore, a clustering protocol must have effective energy and should be fault tolerant. By using the process of TDMA which is stated as PSO-UFC-TDMA, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper on the basis of unequal as well as fault-tolerant clustering. Additional CH, also known as Surrogate Cluster Head (SCH), is selected because of unexpected MCH failure in order to restore connectivity of network in PSO-UFC protocol. Energy is saved using TDMA by allotting timeslots in the transmission of the data. The lifespan of the network is extended by PSO-UFC-TDMA technique compared to PSO-UFC, EBUC, PSO-C as well as LEACH-C protocols which are presented in the simulation results.","Particle swarm optimization,

The resources should be scheduled in a cloud in such a way that users obtain access at any time and with possibly less energy wastage. The proposed algorithm uses an improved Genetic Algorithm that helps reduce overall power consumption as well as performs scheduling of virtual machines so that the nodes are not loaded below or above their capacity. In this case, each chromosome in the population is considered to be a node. Each virtual machine is allocated to a node. The virtual machines on every node correspond to the genes of a chromosome.

In this venture, 3 prediction algorithms are proposed for the prediction and estimation of convergence of ozone gases noticeable all around which are Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) or Decision Trees. The assessment of the expectation models show that the MARS demonstration assesses the dataset better and has accomplished fundamentally better forecast estimation when contrasted with the Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). A point by point near investigation has been completed on the assessment of Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) or Decision trees. MARS provides the outcome by considering about a smaller number of factors when contrasted with other two calculations. In addition, Random Forest calculation sets aside somewhat more time for constructing the tree as the time taken was ascertained to around 45 second for this situation. Also, the variable significance for each and every model has been analyzed. Analyzing each one of the charts the MARS algorithm gives the nearest curve of both learn and the test set when analyzed.

It can be achieved in several ways, one of which is to select the optimal route for data transfer. IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a standardized routing protocol for IoT. The RPL changes its path frequently while transmitting the data from source to the destination, due to high data traffic in dense networks. Hence, it creates data traffic across the nodes in the networks. To solve this issue, we propose Energy and Delay Aware Data aggregation in Routing Protocol (EDADA-RPL) for IoT. It has two processes, namely parent selection and data aggregation. The process of parent selection uses routing metric residual energy (RER) to choose the best possible parent for data transmission. The data aggregation process uses the compressed sensing (CS) theory in the parent node to combine data packets from the child nodes. Finally, the aggregated data transmits from a downward parent to the sink. The sink node collects all the aggregated data and it performs the reconstruction operation to get the original data of the participant node. The simulation is carried out using the Contiki COOJA simulator.

The user can make use of cloud services through broker. But since the job initialization is dynamic the concepts like scheduling of jobs and task management is of crucial importance. The main reason is that the users can request the use of same resources at a time. Thus, managing the resources over the requests is important so that all users can access the resources. Although generic scheduling techniques like FCFS or priority scheduling are available in many ways they fall short in theyre purposeless, due to their own disadvantages. The algorithms have higher waiting time and high turnaround time, which is not that efficient when the number of jobs in cloud environments is very large. Here a hybrid of shortest job first and priority based Scheduling is used and implemented in a cloud environment and analyzed. The conclusions are noted down and they are promising enough. The average waiting time and turnaround time are greatly reduced and highly increased the efficiency of cloud management of resources. Cloud computing includes an online exchange of data, resources, and information, where the users are in constant need of resources. This causes congestion of network, starvation or at worst case a deadlock.

Although, the decryption of information encrypted by using the widely known algorithms proves to a NP-hard process, evidences reveal that decryption (the process of converting encrypted string back to original string, or, successfully cracking the encryption technique) might be slow but it is not unachievable. The necessity to secure the vast amount of information related to a person or an organization, disposal of which might be catastrophic, has given rise to Encryption. Since, the majority of data resides on the cloud, it has become increasingly necessary to make it hectic for a person to breach the security of a cloud. One such algorithm is md5, which is widely used by institutions to encrypt the information residing on their cloud. However, studies have proved that it takes about 2 to the power of 64 values to be encrypted by md5 which can result in a collision, i.e., two or more information strings having the same md5 hash value. Due to the possibility of a security breach, the terms like Salt and Pepper have come into existence. Salt is a string which is unique for each information piece in the database. However, for security purpose, the salt is usually stored in a separate cloud. The information provided by the user is arranged in combination with the salt, on which the md5 algorithm is applied, and the information is then stored in the database. The usage of salt ensures that to decrypt the information, the hacker needs to deduce the salt for the information piece, followed by figuring out the combination in which the information and the salt is arranged, followed by the multiple md5 hashes of the resultant string, which is then used as password. Pepper is another string which is not unique for all information pieces. Also, it is not directly stored in the database. Instead, it is stored in the application itself. This further increases the bulk of computation for the hacker to decrypt the password. The hacker now needs to figure out the pepper, (which is not directly accessible from the database), along with breaching the database for md5 hashed information and its corresponding salt (residing on a different server/cloud)."," Data Center Carbon Footprint Computation,Data Enter Design, Energy Efficiency of Data Enter,Energy Efficient Metrics",,,SRS-JPUB-010,2019-01-05,,,

Users could add their trusted partners into the circle (in this case a hospital staff related to the patients IC unit) and the tweets by the RPI could be identified by them too and necessary action can be taken in case of emergency.

In this regard, the proposed work realizes the necessity of layer-2 and layer-3 controller in LAN and WAN environment separately. A load prediction based alertness approach has been introduced to reduce the burden of the controllers. This approach may create an additional delay for the initial packets of the flow entry that lead to more prediction error.

Routing plays a vital role in IoT to extend the lifespan of the network. Routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) is a standard routing protocol in IoT. The parent selection is a crucial role in the routing process to exchange the data. In RPL, the researchers have introduced a single metric, composite metric, and multiobjective optimization algorithm for parent selection. However, the improper parent selection causes the packet losses, congestion among the network nodes, depletes more energy, and increases the convergence time. To overcome these issues, this article proposes energy efficient optimal parent selection in RPL (EEOPS-RPL) using firefly optimization algorithm to extend the lifespan of the IoT network. In EEOPS-RPL, each node in the network is considered to be firefly and also calculates the current location of firefly, attraction of the fireflies, random function, velocity, and the global best values in the network. Residual energy and expected transmission count are attractiveness parameters and distance is a movement parameter to choose the optimum parent in the destination-oriented directed acyclic graph for data transmission. The simulation is conducted using COOJA. The EEOPS-RPL provides better performance in comparison to the efficient parent selection for RPL (EPC-RPL) and the E-RPL. The EEOPS-RPL improves the packet transmission ratio and lifespan of the network by 2% to 5%, and 5% to 10%, respectively, compared with EPC-RPL and E-RPL.In EEOPS-RPL, each participant node applies the firefly algorithm over the parent node information such as distance, residual energy, and expected transmission count through DODAG information object control message to pick the best parent node in the DODAG. The firefly algorithm provides the fast convergence that able to choose the optimal parent quickly. Thus, it avoids the packet loss during the route establishment in network. Thus, EEOPS-RPL extends the lifespan of the network and reduces the convergence time.","energy conservation, internet of things (iot), routing protocol, low-power and lossy networks, rpl (routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks), parent selection, composite metric, multiobjective optimization algorithm, firefly optimization algorithm, residual energy, expected transmission count, destination-oriented directed acyclic graph, cooja, packet transmission ratio, convergence time",,,SRS-JPUB-037,2020-08-04,,,

Food demand is rising day by day as a result of population growth. Existing farming techniques are not suited for increasing food production. To overcome this issue, we use Internet of Things (IoT), which is one of the emerging technologies in the agriculture field. Generally, the IoT devices consist of low power, low processing and low memory capacity. So, energy plays a significant role in extending the lifespan of the network in the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT). To increase the lifetime of the network, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Grid-based Data Aggregation Scheme in Routing (EGDAS-RPL) protocol for AIoT. It has three processes, namely grid formation, grid head (GH) selection and grid head parent selection. First, EGDAS-RPL forms the equal-sized grid on the square network. Second, it probabilistically selects the GH node within the grid. Finally, it considers the metric expected transmission count (ETX) to select the optimal GH parent for data transfer. The simulation is conducted using the COOJA simulator. The performance of the proposed EGDAS-RPL protocol is compared to RPL and E2HRC-RPL, which reduces the packet loss ratio and end-to-end delay. Thus, EGDAS-RPL protocol increases the lifespan of the network.","agriculture, food production, economic growth, population growth, farming techniques, internet of things (iot), energy, agricultural internet of things (aiot), data aggregation, grid-based, routing protocol, cooja simulator, packet loss ratio, end-to-end delay, network lifespan",,,SRS-JPUB-038,2020-12-01,,,

This paper proposes a new Cluster Head (CH) selection and cluster formation algorithm to overcome these issues. The process has two phases. First, the CH is selected using a Swarm Intelligence Algorithm called Sailfish optimization Algorithm (SOA). Second, the cluster is formed by the Euclidean distance. The simulation is conducted using the NS2 simulator. The efficacy of the SOA is compared to Improved Ant Bee Colony optimization-based Clustering (IABCOCT), Enhanced Particle Swarm optimization Technique (EPSOCT) and Hierarchical Clustering-based CH Election (HCCHE).

However, the conventional data analysis techniques are incapable of processing this huge amount of data. For the efficient processing of high dimensional datasets, it is essential to develop some new parallel methods.Methods: In this work, a novel distributed method is presented using Map-Reduce (MR)-based approach. The proposed algorithm consists of MR-based Fisher score (mrFScore), MR-based ReliefF (mrRefiefF), and MR-based probabilistic neural network (mrPNN) using a weighted chaotic grey wolf optimization technique (WCGWO). Here, mrFScore, and mrRefiefF methods are introduced for feature selection (FS), and mrPNN is implemented as an effective method for microarray classification. The proper choice of smoothing parameter (?) plays a major role in the prediction ability of the PNN which is addressed using a novel technique namely, WCGWO. The WCGWO algorithm is used to select the optimal value of ? in PNN. Results: These algorithms have been successfully implemented using the Hadoop framework. The proposed model is tested by using three large and one small microarray datasets, and a comparative analysis is carried out with the existing FS and classification techniques. The results suggest that WCGWO-mrPNN can outperform other methods for high dimensional microarray classification. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed methods are compared with other existing schemes. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is accurate and robust. Hence, the suggested scheme is considered to be a reliable framework for microarray data analysis. Significance: Such a method promotes the application of parallel programming using Hadoop cluster for the analysis of large-scale genomics data, particularly when the dataset is of high dimension.","Fisher score, Grey wolf optimization, Hadoop, MapReduce, Probabilistic neural network, ReliefF",,,SRS-JPUB-034,2020-06-01,,,

The KarushKuhnTucker conditions have been applied for target controller selection, which ensures improved response time. A switch selection method was also introduced, which minimally affects the end-user QoS during device migration in SDWAN scenario.

These are areas which have high probability of criminal occurrences which are derived based on historical crime records. Thus, with the help of results obtained based on clustering analysis of the crime data, crime trends today can be identified. Crime can be divided into different types such as location-based crimes, theft, murder, kidnap, fraud, etc., and slums, residential areas, commercial areas, etc., are different types of areas where criminal activities may occur. Primary database is collected based on the types of crimes, the location, and the physical description of the suspects and also the time period in which felony has taken place including the other available data relevant to the analysis.

Therefore, DES is one solution that can efficiently overcome the energy crisis and climate change problems. The DES, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), are incorporated to form the microgrid (MG), which are interfaced with the power system. However, interfacing MG to the power system is undoubtedly a big challenge. Therefore, more focus is required on the control strategy to control the MG with the power system. To address the PQ problems, a controlled MG integrated with a hybrid shunt active power filter (HSAPF) is provided in this work. For controlling the MG integrated HSAPF, different control strategies are applied. In this work, a learning-based incremental conductance (LINC) technique is used as a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for tracking the maximum power in PV and WT. The voltage source inverter (VSI) of HSAPF is controlled using a wavelet-based technique with a synchronous reference frame (SRF). The main focus is to improve the PQ by compensating the harmonics and regulating the reactive power in both grid-interactive and islanded condition and also supply continuous and adequate power to the non-linear load. The power system model has been developed with MATLAB/Simulink tool, which shows the efficiency of the proposed method. The results obtained have been satisfactorily under various operating conditions and can be validated further using the real-time dSPACE.","microgrid,hybrid microgrids, hybrid renewable energy system, distributed energy sources, hybrid renewable energy system, learning-based incremental conductance,harmonics, hybrid filter, power quality, total harmonic distortions",,,SRS-JPUB-041,2020-08-12,,,

In fact, some scientists feel that agriculture already produces enough food to feed the world, but of course there are issues and problems with food availability, agricultural production practices, preservation and transportation, and probably more that one can think of that hinder many people in this world from getting adequate food. The basic challenge is to provide food for the needy people. This need can be fulfilled with the help of the farmers taking responsibility in increasing the food production by 50% by the year 2050. The objective of the present work is to increase this food production, protecting the environment with managing natural resources. Mainly focusing on water, nutrients and other inputs to produce foods without degrading the environment. The Goal is to develop the social, environmental, and the economic aspects of possible solutions to minimize the agricultural footprint, and become more sustainable.

IoT devices are incredibly resource-constrained and possess miniature power sources, small memory, and limited processing ability. Clustering is a popular method to avoid duplicate data transfer from the participant node to the destination. The selection of the cluster head (CH) plays a crucial role in gathering and aggregating the data from the cluster members and forwarding the data to the sink node. The inefficient CH selection causes packet failures during the data transfer and early battery depletion nearer to the sink. This paper proposes a cluster tree-based routing protocol (CT-RPL) to increase the life span of the network and avoid the data traffic among the network nodes. The CT-RPL involves three processes, namely cluster formation, cluster head selection, and route establishment. The cluster is formed based on the Euclidean distance. The CH selection is accomplished using a game theoretic approach. Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER), queue utilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX). The simulation is carried out by using a COOJA simulator. The efficiency of a CT-RPL is compared with the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) and energy-efficient heterogeneous ring clustering routing (E2HRC-RPL), which reduces the traffic load and decreases the packet loss ratio. Thus, the CT-RPL enhances the lifetime of the network by 3040% and the packet delivery ratio by 510%.","clustering methods, energy consumption, energy efficiency, game theory,Internet of Things, routing protocol",,,SRS-JPUB-036,2020-10-16,,,

From multiple sources, it is observed that the traffickers generally hide humans in hidden rooms, sealed containers, and boxes disguised as goods. This congestion results in Critical mental and physical damages in some cases. It is practically impossible to physically go and check each box, containers or rooms.

Since its inception, SDN is a subject of a wide range of criticism mainly related to the scalability issues of the control plane. To address these limitations, recent architectures have supported the implementation of multiple controllers. Usage of multiple controllers leads to Controller Placement Problems (CPP) particularly in wide area networks. In most of the placement strategies, authors focused on propagation latency, because it is a critical factor in real networks. In this paper, the placement problem has been formulated on the basis of propagation latency as an optimisation problem, and Simulated Annealing (SA) technique has been used to analyse the problem. Further, we investigate the behaviour of SA with four different neighbouring solutions technique. The effectiveness of the algorithms is carried out on TataNld topology and implemented using MATLAB simulator.","software defined networks, scalability, controller placement problem,simulated annealing, wide area network, controller, switches,propagation delay, topology zoo, greedy, inversion,translation",,,SRS-JPUB-033,2020-09-01,,,

The vulnerability of attacks is on a hike that manual or simple rule-based detection of cyber-attacks is not robust. In order to tackle cyber attacks in a reliable manner, an automated Intrusion Detection system equipped with a swarm intelligence (SI) based machine learning model (ML) is essential to deploy at entry points of the network. Nowadays, the application of SI with ML is used in various research areas. For an efficient IDS, choosing relevant features from the noisy data is an open question. In this regard, this paper proposes a method that utilizes the Whale Pearson hybrid feature selection wrapper for reducing the irrelevancy in the IDS model. Whale Pearson hybrid wrapper is an improved version of the binary Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA). The WOA is a type of SI algorithm which is inspired by the behavior of humpback whales. The proposed method has chosen 8 out of 42 features from the Hackereath Network attack prediction data-set, which are sufficient for building an efficient Intrusion detection model.

Extraction can be abiotic, for example, dry season or abundance light, or biotic, for example, herbivores. Studies have appeared, while plants do demonstrate their pressure by means of variety of leaf in synthetic substance and atomic changes, the shades of leaves are additionally clear markers of plant pressure. In general isolation, deficiency of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in soils results in changes in coloring patterns of leaves. Healthier/stress-free leaves are typically greener in color, while increased yellowing indicates progressively unhealthier leaves.

The disease that persists over a long period of time is known as chronic disease. Chronic diseases may create additional activity restrictions. Common chronic conditions include lung disease, heart stroke, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Chronic diseases usually show no symptoms and hence not diagnosed in advance. Hence, it is necessary to predict the patient-specific chronic diseases in early stage for effective prevention. Machine learning being the vital component of data analytics that facilitates the medical domain for malignancy predictions. Patients suffering from misdiagnosed and undiagnosed chronic diseases can be easily recognized with the help of these hospital systems. These systems enable the doctors to take precautionary measures and thereby minimizing the chances of a patient being affected. A new hybrid K-MLR framework using K-means and multiple linear regression has been proposed for diagnosing the type of lung cancer among the patients. As most of the real datasets are high-dimensional, this hybrid framework uses K-means clustering algorithm that eliminates the noise from the image-based dataset at the initial stage. Afterward to reduce the dimensionality, it detects the features of nodules in 3D lung CT scans and partitions the data to form the clusters. Finally, it reads the new patient data with malignant nodules to predict the type of associated cancer based on the intensity of the nodule features extracted from each CT scan report using multiple linear regression analysis.

The RPL is a standard routing protocol for IoT. It is well-suited for low power and lossy networks (LLN). The RPL provides little security in the IoT network against various attacks. However, one needs to strengthen the security concern in RPL. So, this paper proposes a trust-aware, energy-based reliable routing (TAER-RPL) for IoT to enhance security among network nodes. The TAER-RPL is taken into account the routing metrics, namely trust, ETX, RER to pick the optimal parent for data transmission. The simulation is conducted in COOJA simulator. TAER-RPL's efficiency is compared with SecTrust-RPL and RPL.

Right from the air conditioner and water heaters to phone charging and electricity. Energy has its own role to play in everything that happens. But with increasing number of homes, the power consumption increases. The number of electricity sources does not follow the same rate of increase. So it becomes very difficult to supply all sections of a place with power simultaneously. Some areas will have to face blackout, whereas other places will have proper supply. And the electricity department needs revenue every month. This paper provides an optimal solution to provide electricity to a city divided into different sections or areas, when only a limited amount of energy units are available or generated. Assuming that each grid has its own power consumption and as per that and the revenue, the approach used in the proposed work is 0/1 knapsack problem to provide energy in a smart grid such that almost all of the power is used and maximum revenue is generated. This can be done through various methods like dynamic programming, greedy approach, brute force, backtracking, etc. We also find out that which approach will give the best solution with least time complexity","Generation,

However, clients use low powered devices like mobile phones to share their files. Lightweight cryptography operations are needed to carry out the encryption operations. Ring-LWE-based encryption scheme meets this criterion. In this work, a proxy re-encryption scheme is proposed to distribute the file key.

Each cloudlet is able to process real-time applications with the help of virtual machines (VM). While multiple applications running on the cloudlet, the possibility of overprovisioning issue is unavoidable due to massive task-offloading requests from mobile devices. In this regard, balancing the load, among the cloudlets in a high-interactive applications scenario, is a promising issue. In order to balance the cloudlet load, migration of VMs from an overloaded cloudlet to an underloaded cloudlet is a favored solution. During this process, a well-designed migration mechanism must be outlined that can perform two steps such as VM selection and cloudlet adaption. In this article, an application-aware cloudlet adaption and VM selection framework has been devised for balancing the load in a multicloudlet environment. The candidate-cloudlet adaption is based on a migration efficiency indicator that reduces the response time and enhances load-balancing rate. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework has been evaluated by comparing with other state-of-the-art cloudlet-selection strategies.","mobile users, cloudlet servers, real-time applications, virtual machines, overprovisioning, load balancing, migration, multicloudlet environment, vm selection, migration mechanism, application-aware, response time, load-balancing rate, cloudlet-selection strategies",,,,2020-11-01,,,

One of the primary functions for which we use technology or computers especially is to store and transfer data from a host system or network to another one having similar credentials. The restriction in the capacity of computers means that theres restriction on amount of data which can be stored or has to transport. So, in order to tackle this problem, computer scientists came up with data compression algorithms. A file compression systems objective is to build an efficient software which can help to reduce the size of user files to smaller bytes so that it can easily be transferred over a slower Internet connection and it takes less space on the disk. Data compression or the diminishing of rate of bit includes encoding data utilizing less number of bits as compared to the first portrayal. Compression can be of two writes lossless and lossy. The first one decreases bits by recognizing and disposing of measurable excesses, and due to this reason, no data is lost or every info is retained. The latter type lessens record estimate by expelling pointless or less vital data.

In recent years, various real-time applications have developed to monitor and control physical objects using smart sensors. The use of smart sensors generates a massive amount of data in terms of text, numeric, image and video formats, etc. In IoT, transmitting an enormous amount of data consume more energy. So, clustering is the right option for collecting and exchanging data over the network. Many researchers have used the optimization algorithms to choose cluster head (CH) in the cluster. During the CH rotation, many of the optimization algorithms take more time to converge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new caledonian crow learning algorithm (NCCLA) to identify the appropriate CH in the cluster. Generally, it has two processes, namely cluster formation and CH selection. The Euclidean distance is used to create a cluster within the network. The NCCLA algorithm is proposed to find the best CH on the cluster. Simulation is conducted on MATLAB R2019a. The efficacy of the proposed NCCLA algorithm is compared to the fuzzy clustering particle swarm optimization (FCPSO) and the Improved Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (IFFOA).

Each project has a certain team of designers and developers working for it. The tasks under these projects are created by the manager and allotted to the team members. The efficiency of the team can be enhanced by properly planning when and how a task should be completed. Each task created has certain attributes like priority, estimated time and a due date before which it has to be finished etc. Every project management has several phases. The allotment and execution of tasks is done in the testing phase of the water fall model. Since, there is always concurrency of tasks and there is a possibility of employees working under different projects simultaneously, it is essential that the tasks allotted to them are scheduled. Generally, this scheduling is neglected and employees work on tasks which they feel like to do. But in this project Operating systems scheduling algorithms are used for the scheduling and prioritizing. These scheduling algorithms are tested against practical issues to find out the optimal scheduling algorithm that could be used to schedule the tasks to meet all the deadlines and to utilize the working hours of the employees to the fullest. The advantages and disadvantages of these scheduling algorithms are analyzed by considering few practical cases.","project management system, organizer, scheduler, projects, tasks, developers, designers, efficiency, planning, attributes, waterfall model, concurrency, scheduling algorithms, deadlines, working hours",,,,2019-05-01,,,

Offloading resource intensive task into the cloud is an efficient approach to improve battery utilization, storage capacity and processing capabilities. Efficiently computing using cloud resources to process offloaded task in order to improve response time and reduce both tasks waiting time and latency problems is one of the main goals in mobile cloud computing (MCC). In order to improve user satisfaction and performance of the mobile application, a cloudlet framework concept has been developed to reduce latency problems which improve response time. The cloudlet brings the cloud closer to the user to perform a computational task. This article proposes a new balancing model among cloudlets in mobile cloud computing environment to find the required resources and create an impact on performance. The efficient load balancing model makes mobile cloud computing more attractive and improves user satisfaction.

The air pollution is caused by rapid rise in the concentration of any harmful gas. Ozone (O3), which is the most gaseous pollutants in major cities around the globe, is a major concern for the pollution. The ozone molecule (O3), outside of ozone layer, is harmful to the air quality. This paper focuses on two predictive models which are used to calculate the approximate amount of ozone gas in air. The models being, Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. By evaluating the prediction models, it was found that Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines model has a better prediction accuracy than Random Forest as it produced better datasets. A thorough comparative study on the performances of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Random Forest was performed. Also, variable importance for each prediction model was predicted. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines provides the result by using less variables as compared to the other prediction model. Furthermore, Random Forest model generally takes more time, here it took 45 s more as per the evaluation for building the tree. Monitoring the different graphs produced by the models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines provides the closest curve for both the train set and test set when compared. It can be concluded as the multivariate adaptive regression splines prediction model can be used as a necessary tool in predicting ozone in near future.","environmental concerns, air pollution, ozone, gaseous pollutants, predictive models, random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, prediction accuracy, comparative study, variable importance, prediction model, monitoring, graphs, train set, test set, future prediction",,,,2019-01-01,,,

Energy conservation in WSN is one of the most challenging tasks since the devices are connected to limited resource devices. So, clustering is the best choice to save energy in WSN. The sensor nodes are connected to the animal and move from one location to another because of the dynamic nature. In recent years, several clustering protocols have been proposed using an optimization algorithm to conserve energy in the network. However, it takes more time to converge in selecting the best cluster head in the network. The energy is therefore drained early in the network. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes a Seagull Optimization Algorithm based Energy Aware Cluster Routing Protocol (SOA-EACR) in WSN to prolong the network's lifespan and reduce the end to end delay. The SOA-EACR balances the exploration and exploitation during the CH selection. Thus, it prolongs the lifespan of the network. The simulation is performed using MATLAB 2019a. The efficacy of SOA-EACR is compared with CLPSO, CACONET and GWO. The proposed SOA-EACR enhances the network life by 20 % and increases the packet delivery ratio by 25 %.","wireless sensor networks (wsns), livestock industry, health conditions, energy conservation, clustering, sensor nodes, dynamic nature, clustering protocols, optimization algorithm, cluster head, seagull optimization algorithm, energy aware cluster routing protocol (soa-eacr), end to end delay, matlab 2019a, packet delivery ratio",,,,2022-01-01,,,

IoT can integrate any real-time entity with another, using sensing, computing and communication capabilities to offer enhanced services in everyday life. In this article, IoT-based patient health monitoring is considered for use in IoT sensors deployed in devices. These devices are attached to the body of the patient for timely tracking of his or her health condition. During data transfers from devices connected to the patients body to the doctor, the data may be susceptible to security threats. IoT devices are subjected to many routing attacks, like blackhole, greyhole, Sybil, sinkhole and wormhole attacks. Sybil attacks are the most dangerous routing attacks. This type of attack involves stealing the identities of legitimate nodes; this, in turn, leads to information loss, misinterpretation in the network and an increase in routing disturbances. Hence, in this paper, we propose the use of the traditional Caesar Cipher Algorithm (CCA) along with the lightweight encryption algorithm (LEA) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to detect and prevent Sybil attacks in an IoT environment. The proposed algorithm detects the false node in a particular path by announcing the attack to another node. It also prevents the attack by choosing an alternative path by which to forward data packets to the desired users.

In the IoT transformative paradigm, sensor nodes are enabled to connect multiple physical devices and systems over the network to collect data from remote places, namely, precision agriculture, wildlife conservation, intelligent forestry, and so on. The battery life of sensor nodes is limited, affecting the networks lifetime, and requires continuous maintenance. Energy conservation has become a severe problem of IoT. Clustering is essential in IoT to optimize energy efficiency and network longevity. In recent years, many clustering protocols have been proposed to improve network lifetime by conserving energy. However, the network experiences an energy-hole issue due to picking an inappropriate Cluster Head (CH). CH node is designated to manage and coordinate communication among nodes in a particular cluster. The redundant data transmission is avoided to conserve energy by collecting and aggregating from other nodes in clusters. CH plays a pivotal role in achieving efficient energy optimization and network performance. To address this problem, we have proposed an osprey optimization algorithm based on energy-efficient cluster head selection (SWARAM) in a wireless sensor network-based Internet of Things to pick the best CH in the cluster. The proposed SWARAM approach consists of two phases, namely, cluster formation and CH selection. The nodes are clustered using Euclidean distance before the CH node is selected using the SWARAM technique. Simulation of the proposed SWARAM algorithm is carried out in the MATLAB2019a tool.

As a result, the study covers evasion attacks and their detection within the context of website classifiers, which is rarely explored.

PQ issues are raised not only in normal three-phase systems but also with the incorporation of different distributed generations (DGs), including renewable energy sources, storage systems, and other systems like diesel generators, fuel cells, etc. The prevalence of these issues comes from the non-linear features and rapid changing of power electronics devices, such as switch-mode converters for adjustable speed drives and diode or thyristor rectifiers. The wide use of these fast switching devices in the utility system leads to an increase in disturbances associated with harmonics and reactive power. The occurrence of PQ disturbances in turn creates several unwanted effects on the utility system. Therefore, many researchers are working on the enhancement of PQ using different custom power devices (CPDs). In this work, the authors highlight the significance of the PQ in the utility network, its effect, and its solution, using different CPDs, such as passive, active, and hybrid filters.

In IoT, the network plays a crucial role in collecting data from sensors and moving to the sink. Increasing the network lifetime is a challenging task in IoT, which is connected to devices that are limited by resource. Clustering is one of the effective methods of increasing the network lifetime. However, improper cluster head (CH) selection easily drains the energy early in network nodes. With the aim to overcome the issue, this paper proposes the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic-based Particle Swarm Optimization (T2FL-PSO) algorithm to select the optimal CH to extend the network lifetime. The T2FL is highly useful in providing the accurate solution in uncertain network environments. Hence, T2FL is applied on the network parameters, residual energy, and the distance between sensor node and base station to determine the fitness value. Later, virtual clusters are formed on the basis of distance between sensor node and CH and between node and base station. To validate the performance of the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm, extensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB 2019a. Furthermore, the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization Clustering (PSO-C) and Particle Swarm Optimization Wang Zhang (PSO-WZ). The result confirms that the proposed T2FL-PSO increases the network lifetime by 10%15% and the packet transmission ratio by 10%.

Clustering is an effective technique for saving energy by reducing duplicate data. In a clustering protocol, the selection of a cluster head (CH) plays a key role in prolonging the lifetime of a network. However, most cluster-based protocols, including routing protocols for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs), have used fuzzy logic and probabilistic approaches to select the CH node. Consequently, early battery depletion is produced near the sink. To overcome this issue, a lion optimization algorithm (LOA) for selecting CH in RPL is proposed in this study. LOA-RPL comprises three processes: cluster formation, CH selection, and route establishment. A cluster is formed using the Euclidean distance. CH selection is performed using LOA. Route establishment is implemented using residual energy information. An extensive simulation is conducted in the network simulator ns-3 on various parameters, such as network lifetime, power consumption, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and throughput. The performance of LOA-RPL is also compared with those of RPL, fuzzy rule-based energyefficient clustering and immune-inspired routing (FEEC-IIR), and the routing scheme for IoT that uses shuffled frog-leaping optimization algorithm (RISARPL). The performance evaluation metrics used in this study are network lifetime, power consumption, PDR, and throughput.

Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to the Internet. As the control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, the goal of this paper is to detect the attack traffic, by taking the centralized control aspect of SDN. Nowadays, in the field of SDN, various machine learning (ML) techniques are being deployed for detecting malicious traffic. Despite these works, choosing the relevant features and accurate classifiers for attack detection is an open question. For better detection accuracy, in this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is assisted by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed SVM model, KPCA is used for reducing the dimension of feature vectors, and GA is used for optimizing different SVM parameters. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed. The experimental results show that compared to single-SVM, the proposed model achieves more accurate classification with better generalization.

Trusting a third party has its own ramifications and results in a centralized architecture; therefore, this article addresses these issues by designing a Blockchain-based distributed IoT architecture that uses hash chains for secure key management. The proposed architecture exploits the key characteristics of the Blockchain technology, such as openness, immutability, traceability, and fault tolerance, to ensure data privacy in IoT scenarios and, thus, provides a secure environment for communication.

Providing security to this data is a challenging task. The development in the internet attracts several vulnerable attacks. The researchers in the literature proposed several machine learning, Deep learning and ANN based approaches for efficient attack detection. However, these approaches are prone to high false alarm rates and exhibits poor performance for diversified incoming traffic, because these methodologies relay on the packet level or transaction level features. The performance is inversely proposal to the diversity ratio of packet level features. To handle this, we introduced a combination of high-performed evolutionary algorithms and neural networks for attack classification at flow level with low false alarm rates and high detection accuracy. A unique set of flow features are defined to handle the traffic at flow level and optimal feature selection using whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The gravitational search (GS), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) combinations are used in attack detection phase to train the ANN and results proposed model as GSPSO-ANN with WOA. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated with NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. The results are compared with other ANN based conventional methods.

Considering this criteria, there exists channel and spatial attention where in channel attention considers the most attentive channel among the produced block of channels and spatial attention considers which region among the space needs to be focused on.

Its main deployment is in the transmitter and receiver of the antenna. While transmission, the transmitter of radio at the extremities of the antenna furnishes the electricity which oscillates at the frequency of radio wave and energy is released as current as em waves. Some of the voltage is formed from the em wave that is invaded at the point of receiving to amplify the receiver. This study focuses on the analysis of the satellite system to aid in mobile antenna tracking. It also examines the techniques for fuzzy control which make up traditional networks that are used. Initially, a basic idea of tracking loops with stabilized antennas was suggested in light of the requirement for the margin of phase and bandwidth. If the gain of the track is reduced due to changes in attributes and throughput, it will be reduced. In addition, fuzzy regulators and PID constituents are used to enhance the loop. The results indicate that the higher and lower antenna tracking gains within the loop were the best fit and the loop's fluctuations are reduced. A controller based on fuzzy logic can be most efficient due to its simplicity and robustness. It is also discovered that fuzzy logic controllers are evaluated by their behavior in relation. This paper presents an evaluation of the controllers in fuzzy logic, which is based on its integration with conventional controllers. There are three gains in PID's regulator PID and every gain can be used to control the variables of inputs and outcomes. The effects of the responses were analyzed and were compared. The commonality was discovered in the results according to the increase in time for II/6 and II/3 based on PID's regulator PID stability, it can be improved by this system, and there is a reduction in the duration of stability. Furthermore, the period of stability may be reduced through the fusion of PID and fuzzy. The effectiveness of the system could be enhanced by the implementation of the neural network. It is also possible to design the two types of control that could be used to control the proposed solid platform","antenna, radio, transmitter, receiver, waves, electricity, satellite, mobile, tracking, fuzzy control, pid, regulator, loop, stability, neural network",,,,2022-03-07,,,

This paper presents the Multi-User Groupwise Integrity Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (GI-CPABE), an efficient framework designed to ensure robust data security. By implementing an Improved Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (ICP-ABE), the GI-CPABE framework is designed to be compatible with both homogeneous and heterogeneous cloud environments, providing secure access that is role-specific and reliable. A distinctive feature of this framework is its role-based access control mechanism, which efficiently assigns user access rights and roles based on multi-user group attributes, considered as integrity measures. An experimental setup was established on a real-time cloud server, simulating a cloud based EHR system. Test data, mimicking real-world EHRs, was generated and subjected to encryption and decryption processes, evaluating the time efficiency of these operations. The proposed GI-CPABE framework demonstrated optimized storage utilization by calculating the overhead of encrypted data, ensuring data integrity through defined attribute-based policies, and enabling secure, controlled access to medical data. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was conducted to ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed framework against existing models. The implementation of access control mechanisms exhibited robust enforcement of access controls tailored to different user roles such as healthcare providers, patients, and administrators.","Group integrity, group access control ,Cloud data security, encryption, Blockchain, medical data.

Today many automated companies are designing vehicles, but we are still unable to get automatic parking system in an area. Finding free parking slot/space has a probability of revealing user's privacy (i.e., either by service provider to third party/attacker or submitted information [user personal information] can be hacked by an attacker [via performing attacks like Man in Middle, Denial of Service, etc.]). Hence, privacy is a main issue in parking. Providing sufficient privacy in parking to vehicle users is a primary concern of this chapter.

The discovery of appropriate patterns and trends to analyse the text documents from this large big data (i.e., large volume of data) is a big issue. Text mining is a process of extracting interesting and non- trivial patterns from huge amount of text documents. There exist different techniques and tools to mine the text (also other data format) and discover valuable information for future prediction and decision making process. Basically, there are two terms used in making or extracting some relevant information from a data-set, i.e., prediction modelling, and text mining. Predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place/to detect an email, how likely that it is spam. Similarly, text mining used in applications like digital libraries, academic research field, life science, social media, business intelligence, etc. Todays different text mining techniques are available for analysing the text patterns and their mining process, some of them are included here as: document classification (text classification, document standardization), information retrieval (keyword search/querying and indexing), document clustering (phrase clustering), natural language processing (spelling correction, lemmatization, grammatical parsing, and word sense disambiguation), information extraction (relationship extraction/link analysis), and web mining (web link analysis), etc.

workloads, and its resources are elastic in nature. It attracts many IT industry and organization, as it
reduces the initial investment and running capital. The overall performance of a cloud provider should be
good enough to deliver the promised Quality of Service (QoS) to the end users. Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS) provider possesses multiples of Virtual Machine (VM) to perform the full functionality
demanded by the users. Hence overall performance of a cloud provider mainly depends on VMs. But
VMs are heavy and slow in nature as it possesses its own OS and dependent on the hypervisor. Our
focus is to enhance the performance by employing an alternate substitute to VMs. Recently, Docker
containers emerged with upgraded performance compared to VMs. Docker containers are incorporated
to handle the user request which in turn improves the performance of cloud provider. A private cloud
provider scales up its financial gains, only when it is capable of fulfilling all the demands of users which
are dynamic in nature. To meet out the user request during peak demands, a private cloud provider can
make use of public cloud resources, when its own resources are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose
a hybrid framework to make use of the public cloud like Amazon Web Service (AWS) to fulfill the user
request. To compare the performance of VM and Docker container, an open-source testing software tool
namely Apache JMeter is employed to perform a load tests. Also, we demonstrate the outstanding
performance of the docker containers in terms of throughput, average response time, etc. The
experimental results prove that Docker containers outperform VMs almost in all metrics.","Virtual Machine, Docker Container, Apache JMeter, Throughput, Average Response Time",,,,2020-06-01,,,

Due to mobility node can enter and leave a network at any moment. Due to unstable nature of MANETs, the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) to the applications is a difficult task. In this paper, fuzzy logic enabled QoS multicast routing is proposed. Here energy, bandwidth and link expiry time are considered as a QoS parameters. The existing methods lost their performance in handling multi constrained QoS protocols, since defining the dynamic priorities among the multiple QoS parameters is not a trivial task. In the proposed method Fuzzy Logic Aware QoS Multicasting in MANETs with Load Balance-FQML, this issue is overcome by using fuzzy logic. The Competency Factor of each intermediate node along the route is calculated by aggregating its QoS parameters using fuzzy inference system. In the classical multicast protocols, some of the nodes in the multicast tree are overloaded by having multiple branches towards the destination nodes. This leads to partition of the multicast tree and degrades the performance of protocols. In the proposed method, this problem is handled by limiting the number of branches at intermediate nodes. The results are taken in network simulator-ns2, where the proposed method could measure less number of path failures and improved results than existing methods.","Competency Factor, Fuzzy Logic, Multicast tree, Quality of Service",,,,2018-01-01,,,

Heterogeneity, scale, timeliness, complexity, and privacy problems with Big Data impede progress at all phases of the pipeline that can create value from data. Much data today is not natively in structured format for example, tweets and blogs are weakly structured pieces of text, while images and video are structured for storage and display, but not for semantic content and search transforming such content into a structured format for later analysis is a major challenge. Data analysis, organization, retrieval, and modeling are other foundational challenges. Data analysis is a clear bottleneck in many applications, both due to lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms and due to the complexity of the data that needs to be analyzed. Finally, presentation of the results and its interpretation by non-technical domain experts is crucial to extracting actionable knowledge. Issues related to data security and privacy is of cardinal concern in the age of big data as the data volume is high. The growing popularity and development of big data technologies bring serious threat to the security of individuals sensitive information. Implementing security and privacy policies is a challenge in the era of big data. Governmental agencies, healthcare industry, private organizations invest large resources into the collection, aggregation, and sharing of large amounts of personal data.

Secondly, we fine-tune VGG and pruned ResNets and utilize them as feature extractors and connect them to fully connected dense networks. The hyperparameters are tuned to reach faster convergence and obtain better generalization during stochastic optimization of Bi-CNN (s).

The early diagnosis of COVID-19 is hence critical for prevention and limiting this pandemic before it engulfs the humanity. With early diagnosis, the patient may be suggested for self-isolation (or) quarantine under medical supervision. Early detection of COVID-19 can save the patient and minimize the risk of falling prey to CoviD-19. Machine learning, a subset field of Artificial Intelligence can provide a viable solution for early diagnosis of disease and facilitate continuous monitoring of infected patients. AI based approaches can provide a view of the degree of disease severity. In general, Artificial intelligence (AI) could be a better technique for quantitative evaluation of the disease to obtain fruitful results.

In phase 1, SSPL computes scan depth of the involved sorted positional index lists. During retrieving the lists in a round-robin fashion, SSPL performs pruning on any candidate positional index to discard the candidate whose corresponding tuple is not skyline result. Phase 1 ends when there is a candidate positional index seen in all of the involved lists.

The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking supports large data sets in widely-distributed storage systems. It is also superior in performance by minimizing the use of expensive public-key cryptography in metadata management.

the fact that a significant number of deaths could
have been avoided, had there been a helmet. Most
people tend to neglect the importance of the helmet

intervention detects whether the person is nonalcoholic breath while driving and wearing the
helmet. This smart helmet collects, generates, and
converts information on sensors. The collected
information for helmet sensors is used to monitor the

Here, the load balancing strategy estimates the underloaded and overloaded system and balances the nodes as required. Thus, a load balancing strategy has been performed to equally load all connected Virtual machines (VM) in the cloud environment. However, conventional Load balancing methods in cloud computing confront non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness optimization issues. Therefore, this article has proposed a novel Load balancing methodology between VMs using the Hybrid Krill herd and Whale-based Deep Belief Neural model (HKHW-DBNM). This proposed method aims to improve the system's performance by balancing the Load between the VMs, optimizing the makespan, improving resource usage, reducing the degree of imbalance, and so on. Here, the developed load balancing algorithm distributes workload across multiple resources by reducing the demand on each resource and improving overall system performance. Furthermore, it helps to guarantee that resources are utilized efficiently, reducing execution time and optimizing costs. The implementation of this process has been carried out in the Python platform. The robustness of the proposed system is verified via the comparison with existing Load balancing approaches. The comparison results show that the proposed load-balancing method performs better than existing methods.","Cloud computing,

Consequently, different operating systems and virtual machines have validated the users requirements and necessitated effective scheduling techniques in the cloud environment. Moreover, resource allocation and job scheduling are significant features in cloud computing. Nevertheless, the main drawback of the cloud computing model is the higher computation time that causes the deadline of all work. Previously, several approaches were proposed to diminish the computation time, but those techniques only apply to a few tasks. Therefore the novel Whale-based Convolution Neural Framework (WbCNF) strategy can effectively improve the task allocation system and reduce the job execution time. Moreover, the developed approach is implemented in the Python framework, and results show that the computation time has reduced the quantity of the tasks taken for the experimentation.

Intruder detection, feature extraction, and data processing are all included in the novel optimization-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) paradigm that will be presented in this study.

Young people who are technologically savvy have witnessed a significant scientific increase in the latter two areas. Despite this, farming is still regarded as a labor-intensive endeavour. Most farmers are uneducated and lack a scientific understanding of farming practices. Crop cultivation anywhere in the world is dependent on the climate, also known as seasons, and soil properties; however, increasing crop production is dependent on a variety of factors, most notably temperature. This work proposes a crop recommendation system to address the issue of increasing crop production. A vision of the perfect harvest before planting would be extremely beneficial to farmers and other stakeholders in making appropriate decisions about improving yields for local use, and it may inspire increased capacity and a wider range of product options for businesses. Precision agriculture is a modern farming strategy that advises farmers on the sorts of crops they should plant based on data collected through studies on soil features, soil types, and crop yields. This style of agriculture is also known as ""high-intensity agriculture"". Our system employed Machine Learning procedures to recommend the appropriate crops. This system then reduces the financial losses experienced by farmers because of establishing the ominous harvests. This problem is addressed in this paper by proposing a recommendation system using an ensemble model with majority voting and an accuracy of 99.4 percent.","Crop recommendation,Machine learning,Ensemble model,Voting classifier,Recommendation system",Machine learning,active,,2023-07-06,,,

One of the primary challenges faced in this domain is the limited battery resources of sensor nodes. Addressing this issue is crucial for extending the overall network lifetime. The sleep scheduling method, also known as duty cycling, emerges as an effective strategy by alternating between active and sleep modes for specific nodes. While this approach efficiently conserves energy, the occurrence of node failures remains a critical concern. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces the Failure Recovery for Node in Sleep Scheduling (FRNSS) algorithm. The FRNSS algorithm aims to enhance sensing capabilities, maximize network lifetime, and achieve energy efficiency. Through comprehensive evaluations, it is demonstrated that the proposed FRNSS algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of sensing coverage, energy consumption, and the reduction of control messages, thereby offering a promising solution for robust and efficient wireless sensor networks.","wireless sensor networks, scheduling, fault-tolerance, sensing Coverage, fault tolerant Algorithm",,,,2023-11-27,,,
